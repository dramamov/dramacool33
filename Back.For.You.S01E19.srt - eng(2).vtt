00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.520
You're a guy, after all.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480
If you like someone in the future,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.840
just say it out loud.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.080
Don't worry.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.160
I'm not going anywhere.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.760
I'll be right here waiting for you.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.960
I won't let you stay with that person.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.520
I'll take you away.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600
I'll stand up for her, just like her parents.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.280
Is that okay?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.440
You're alone right now.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.520
If you catch a cold,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.080
who will take care of you?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.040
Hello, I'm from the noodle shop downstairs.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.840
Here's your egg noodles.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.560
Thank you.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.040
I'll head downstairs now.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.320
No, you can't.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.120
You can't go back right now.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.120
Are you okay?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.520
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.040
Yu Xingchen, what's wrong?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.760
Don't tell me your illness is acting up again.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.240
Can you still stand up, Yu Xingchen?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.360
Su Ruo.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.120
Happy birthday.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.160
Little girl.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.880
Doctor, how is he?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.880
It's nothing serious.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.400
The report shows no issues.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.880
You senior students...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.840
are under too much pressure.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.280
Your diet and schedule are all over the place.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.760
I've prescribed you some nutrients.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.240
Please pick it up at the pharmacy.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.680
Thank you.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.240
I'll go get the medicine, wait for me.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.560
Every time you come back,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.320
what happens in World A

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.600
will keep happening.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.960
The girl you like

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.640
in World A,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.320
will still die.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.120
I bought this for you.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.320
Su Ruo, I'm much better now.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.880
Stop working, take a break.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.760
It's fine.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.880
I'll ask the doctor about precautions.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.960
I didn't expect my eighteenth birthday

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.520
would be spent in a hospital.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.400
But I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.440
It's unforgettable.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.120
And look,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.040
eighteen means you're an adult.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.520
As an adult,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.400
you have to learn to care for others.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.920
If someday

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.000
you start a family,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.800
it's okay.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.720
I know there are two of you.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.680
Everything will get better.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.240
It's not two of me.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.640
There are two worlds.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.680
So your parents

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.160
prepared so much for me.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.800
When you go back,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.440
please thank them for me.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.080
I'll put these in your fridge.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.720
Remember to eat them.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.200
Mm-hmm.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.360
Is the light on at that house?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.400
Yeah, it is.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.240
Looks like they're setting off fireworks.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.040
But it's not a holiday today.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.320
Maybe it's for a girl someone likes.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.680
Kids these days

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.720
are really mature early.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.120
What a coincidence.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.360
Isn't it your birthday today?

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.720
Why hasn't the leading lady shown up?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.760
Su Ruo.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.560
Happy birthday.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.040
No matter if it's you here

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.560
or you in another world,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.920
What's going on with you?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.320
The college entrance exam is coming up.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.000
I don't want Yu Xingchen to hold me back.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.520
So I asked to move to the front row.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.680
Is there a problem?

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.760
We've been deskmates for a year,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.400
and I feel a bit sad to leave.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.080
That's all.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.320
Nothing else to say.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.920
Good luck on your exam.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.560
Yu Xingchen.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.680
When we were deskmates,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.360
I bullied you quite a bit.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.800
I feel pretty bad about it now.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.480
Don't take it to heart.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.120
Yu Xingchen,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.240
we'll be deskmates for the next three months.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.440
Teacher Jiang arranged it.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.680
You'd better study hard.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.880
But I still think

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.520
drawing an auxiliary line saves more time.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.000
Your method is better than mine.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.040
Hui Ge.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.400
Can you solve this problem another way?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.400
What's up with you today?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.320
You look so out of it.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.120
I'm the type who plans my time precisely.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.400
But last night someone asked me to watch fireworks.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.320
Maybe it went too late.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.280
My biological clock got a bit messed up.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.200
Fireworks? You saw fireworks last night too?

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.000
I wish I'd really seen them.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.040
All I saw was the debris.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.440
What a waste of time.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.440
Class President.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.480
Did everyone get this problem right?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.520
This one's easy.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.000
It uses a middle school formula.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.720
It's basically a freebie.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.760
But some people didn't solve it, right?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.200
For example,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.840
my deskmate.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.960
You mean Yu Xingchen?

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.040
Are you really okay now?

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.960
My illness hits me like a landslide,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.520
but goes away like a rushing stream.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.960
I mean,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.720
it comes quickly,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.840
and leaves quickly.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.920
But I heard the class president say

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.360
you're forgetting even middle school formulas.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.200
That's normal.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.280
Middle school feels so far away.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.920
You have to work hard.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.480
Don't end up missing college.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.600
That won't do.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.360
Whether I get into college

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.040
doesn't depend on how hard I try.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.560
I think it depends on when I can go back.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.720
I mean, I have to see

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.000
which version of me takes the exam then.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.480
Don't worry too much.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.880
You learned so fast.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.720
Smart.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.360
I went to several bookstores.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.000
This book.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.800
I wanted to buy it because...

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.520
Thank you.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.440
You've read this book?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.560
I was just curious.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.280
So I opened it to take a look.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.520
Thank you.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.520
Let me have a bite of your meat.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.720
It looks delicious.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.040
Teacher Jiang.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.640
Su Ruo has low blood sugar.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.320
I thought I'd share my pork chop with her.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.360
To give her some energy.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.800
That makes sense, right?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.360
Makes sense.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.000
Teacher Jiang.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.200
It's not what you think.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.480
I didn't say anything.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.360
Why are you so nervous?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.280
You have low blood sugar.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.600
Next time you feel unwell,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040
have some candy.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.320
Yu Xingchen.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.440
Come to my office.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.360
This isn't the time for outside reading.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.880
I'll return your books after the college entrance exam.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.520
Oh, everyone, don't leave yet.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.160
I'll take you all to see the fireworks.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.400
Fireworks?

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:02.840
Let's go, let's go.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.480
Follow me.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.080
Come on, let's watch the fireworks.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.440
Tonight,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.840
when a girl appears on that balcony,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.440
light the fireworks for me.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.120
Is it for a girl you like?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.960
Got it?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.680
Kids these days...

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.760
are really mature.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.760
Where are my fireworks?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.160
Who set off my fireworks?

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.520
It's fine.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.920
You've already done enough.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.280
Thank you.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.760
Darn it, what did I do to deserve this?
