00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:04.167
Hello everyone, I'm Moon
Do-ha from Challengers...

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:05.809
- You have to push me really hard in a sec.
- And say:

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.268
"I'm really looking
forward to this new project!"

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:08.833
What is he doing?

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:10.976
They said they're filming
behind-the-scenes footage.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.875
Behind-the-scenes footage?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.018
Right here, we have our...

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.125
special guest, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.250
Please say hello.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.458
Hello everyone.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.458
I'm Gu Jae-yeon.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.875
Ah, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.167
There's something I'm
really curious about...

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.917
In these so-called action movies,

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.917
do you... actually hit each other for real?

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:39.893
- When you're in the moment...
- things can get more intense than planned.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.768
Sometimes you hit harder
than you mean to, right?

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.042
Isn't that something you
need to apologize for?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.667
That bastard...

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:58.167
Are you messing with me?

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.292
Why are you being so unreasonable?

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:01.500
Hey!

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.167
Watch what you say when
you're in front of the camera.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.667
What did I say to deserve that?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.292
I didn't even say anything.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:18.000
What's wrong?

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.667
Feeling guilty about something?

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.417
No... You're an idol, so why act like this?

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:24.375
For the measly stunt team?

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.250
That what?

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.083
Well...

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:33.833
But because of that 'measly' stunt team,

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.833
your whole career might get ruined.

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.542
Right now, I'm...

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.809
just so curious about why Mr. Gu Jae-yeon
had to take that beating.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.583
I'm just so curious.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.292
And I was just about
to start asking around.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.583
Maybe I was born to be a manager.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:56.750
How interesting.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.792
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.125
What were you doing a while ago?

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.875
Trying to repay a favor?

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.542
Consider this my
payment for the fried rice.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.542
Sit still.

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.542
No but, when my temper flares up...

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.542
These things just happen
when you're working.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:28.750
Ah, I'm just...

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.333
I'm such a terrible actor, really!

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.250
No, I'm truly sorry.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:43.875
I told you I was busy. Why
did you suggest going there?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880
We still have filming
tomorrow, and now this...

00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:47.583
Are you tired?

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:48.750
Not at all.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:50.000
Not tired at all.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.601
Director, you were looking for me?

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.083
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon, you're here.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.583
Looks like we're saved now.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:30.768
Thank you for your hard work.

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:32.042
How's Moon Do-ha?

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:33.208
Huh?

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:34.208
I'm asking how he is.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.917
I'm taking over, so I need
to know what I'm getting into.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.940
He's... should I say, he's the
type to be up for a challenge?

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:46.292
He's a very competitive guy.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.125
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.625
Thank you.

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.182
The footage should turn out great, right?

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:56.750
What's this?

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.667
Trying to butter me up now?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.083
But isn't it a little too late for that?

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.000
Today is your last day.

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.250
Too bad, but what can you do?

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.333
That's just how life is...

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:19.750
You have to seize
opportunities when they come.

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:25.583
Seriously...

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:26.833
Moon Do-ha.

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:31.059
With an injury like this, how
do we handle the insurance?

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:32.883
So, does this count as
a work-related injury?

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:34.167
The injury is too minor!

00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:36.000
You should have been more careful!

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.833
By the way, don't
you have a session today?

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:42.250
Me?

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.250
Yeah, today Moon Do-ha...

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.542
Ah...

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.507
You're not training
Moon Do-ha anymore?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:50.250
Yeah, I'm free now.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.875
Then can you check my form?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.375
- Just once!
- Hey, wait a minute.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.833
I said I was going to ask first.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:56.958
I said it first!

00:04:57.042 --> 00:04:58.125
Just once is fine.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.000
I just need to practice the timing.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.125
So this is where you were.

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:05.625
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.958
So, what exactly is up?

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.125
I'm screwed.

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:18.208
Good, very good.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.333
Come on, come on.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:21.625
Good work today. You can go home.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.667
Whoa! Your form is pretty good.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Are we done?

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.375
I usually only train people like that.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.420
Besides, your face
does all the work.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.708
Good work!

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.042
But is there a problem with that?

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:37.643
Isn't this the kind of training you wanted?

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.101
For difficult action scenes,
physical conditioning is essential.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.351
For the time being, Mr. Moon Do-ha

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.250
will be training alongside
our team members.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.125
Well...

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.833
There's no time, so why bother?

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.583
That's enough.

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.417
You need to take responsibility.

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.268
Because of you, I'm stuck with
this half-assed training.

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:55.452
I'm not satisfied, so you
have to take responsibility.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.125
Then starting tomorrow,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.917
I'll contact you.

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:03.583
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.500
What?

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:11.792
I've already completed the
full handover to the director.

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:14.309
And I've already reached an
agreement with the team about this.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.208
What's with this attitude?

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.667
Is that any way to treat the person
who brought you food?

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:20.917
Ah...

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:23.000
Are you saying 'we're even' now?

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:31.375
If... outside of the training sessions,
you need my help with anything,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
I'm always willing to help.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.292
Then... you may leave.

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.042
So, are you free tomorrow?

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:43.458
Tomorrow?

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:49.792
I am.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.458
Okay, see you tomorrow then.

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:03.167
Why is there so much to film today?

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:05.417
I knew it.

00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:08.042
Hyung, you can go ahead.

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:09.792
What are you talking about?

00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:12.917
The special manager who was
supposed to come today is here.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.250
Is that Mr. Moon Do-ha's practice room?

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.583
I brought the protective gear...

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.625
Should I grab the wrist guards too?

00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:29.292
What the...

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:30.208
Mr. Do-ha, this...

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:31.934
This was supposed to be for your manager.

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:32.833
I couldn't find him.

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.333
This is today's filming schedule.

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.708
So this was supposed
to go to the manager...

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:39.125
- I don't know where he is...
- Assistant Director?

00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:41.542
The manager is here.

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.250
Manager!

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.893
Where have you been? Hurry
up and go check the wardrobe.

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:47.125
Me?

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.833
How can I be a manager?

00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.542
Why not? Even I've done it.

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.292
- Um...
- You did say you were always willing to help.

00:07:54.417 --> 00:07:55.500
I even checked the date.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.042
Is Mr. Moon Do-ha's manager here?

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.208
Are you just going to let her be like that?

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.643
The standby time has been
extended from 30 minutes to 50.

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:03.809
Please check the shooting schedule.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.458
The PD confirmed this
outfit and requested a change.

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.792
How can they change it so suddenly?

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:11.833
Manager,
you should have stopped them.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.708
He's always like this. I can't work.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:14.667
I'm sorry.

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:16.125
Ah, seriously.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:16.667
Huh?

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:17.333
Huh?

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.250
Huh?

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:21.208
Isn't that the guy from Do-ha's
vlog?

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.208
You're right, it is!

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.708
Oh my gosh, what do I do?

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:25.500
Could you take a picture with me, please?

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:26.625
W-With me?

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:30.958
Thank you so much!

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:36.518
Manager, please give
me wardrobe option one.

00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:37.583
Yes.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.458
This one... they said it should
be paired with the bracelet.

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:41.750
Yes, understood.

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.000
What is this...

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.958
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.958
I'm sorry, I was running around like crazy.

00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:52.875
Anyway, the wardrobe has been changed.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.875
Please change into this.

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.625
Anyone who didn't know better
would think you're a real manager.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.630
Not even my own
has helped me like this.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:05.417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:07.833
What is it?

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.250
Yes, we're getting ready
to shoot. Please stand by.

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.792
No, please head over.

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:15.000
Go on, what is it?

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:19.292
I also... wanted to be in
charge of your training.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:20.976
But because of the established procedures,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.417
we can't do it, so...

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:23.750
I'm sorry.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.667
What was that...

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.583
Here, please take good care of this.

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.792
You're my manager, after all.

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:39.792
Right?

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:42.125
Um...

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.917
Do a good job.

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:47.292
Fighting!

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:50.208
Have you ever seen me fail at anything?

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.667
Young-woo, Young-woo.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.583
Where did Jae-yeon go?

00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:56.292
I don't know. Did he go
out with Moon Do-ha?

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:57.875
Did they go for outdoor training?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.625
Anyway, he is a 'stuntman'
through and through.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.583
Hmm?

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.875
To think he'd take an actor outside...

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.250
They're outside, all right.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.625
But I doubt it's for training.

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:14.309
(Moon Do-ha and a stunt actor, even visiting
the set?) (Real-time proof of real friendship!)

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:15.958
Jae-yeon?

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:18.250
How's the action school?

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.375
Is everything going well?

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:21.042
It's going great.

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.167
I'm great at everything I do.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.042
That guy... he's trending again.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:28.375
Who?

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.750
Oh... Gu Jae-yeon.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.583
We didn't do anything, though.

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:38.125
Not you, with another actor.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.833
Huh?

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.292
What is it?

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.863
Popular Stunt Actor Gu Jae-yeon.

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.833
Turns Out to Be Actor Shin
Jun-ho's Original Stunt Double.

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.792
It's in the news.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.476
Bro, I think you're actually famous now.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.500
Shin Jun-ho is trying to act all chummy...

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:02.018
Chummy? What are you talking about?

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:03.500
He just said we'd worked together.

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:04.708
But is that okay?

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.375
Creating buzz without your permission?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.458
Wow, Shin Jun-ho is using you for clout?

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:11.583
Bro, just how famous are you going to get?

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:13.125
Famous? Don't be ridiculous.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.417
It's just temporary.

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:16.542
For something temporary,
it's lasting a while.

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.083
Hasn't a lot already changed?

00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:21.583
Like... how people around you are reacting?

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:23.792
Nothing like that.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:26.042
Let's watch together.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.500
Look.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.792
Isn't Jae-yeon way more
handsome than Shin Jun-ho?

00:11:29.917 --> 00:11:31.333
Of course.

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:34.125
Do you like Jae-yeon?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.542
Why am I in such a bad mood?

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:58.542
Hmm?

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:00.958
"Hey..."

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:02.458
"Hello, Moon Do-ha."

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.253
"You know I haven't
started filming yet, right?"

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:10.917
"Yes."

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:12.792
"Is this how you treat people you know?"

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:16.708
"Don't tell me before
this job is even over,"

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:18.553
"you're already moving on to someone else?"

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:22.559
"If my reputation takes
a hit because of this,"

00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:24.000
"will you take responsibility?"

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.000
What the...

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:33.750
Why isn't he responding?

00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:37.917
"I'll be more careful from now on."?

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:47.667
Hey, hey!

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.000
Bro, did you see this?

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.667
There's news about Moon Do-ha's movie.

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:53.000
Your name is in it, too.

00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:54.583
Oh, really?

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:57.917
Why are you...

00:12:58.042 --> 00:12:59.750
Is something bothering you?

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:04.917
Reputation?

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:08.708
Did I do something wrong?

00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:15.875
Are you free after your schedule today?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.458
Why?

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:21.167
I'd like to treat you to dinner.
That's why I was asking.

00:13:21.292 --> 00:13:22.932
It's a place an actor I know recommended.

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:25.282
It's been a while since I've
had a proper, healthy meal.

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.542
So, where did you say you were going?

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:34.417
He said it's a place an
actor friend recommended.

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:36.333
Your old classmate is
really well-connected.

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:38.292
Bro, are you going to meet him?

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:39.958
It's not a date, is it?

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:41.601
I'm going to a class
reunion. What's it to you?

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:42.417
So lame.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:44.434
You seem close with
your old classmates.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:46.417
Mine went our separate
ways a long time ago.

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:48.958
No... we're not particularly close.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:50.542
Then why are you going?

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:53.708
This year, they suddenly
scheduled it around my availability.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:55.583
I'm heading out.

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.458
See you, bro.

00:14:01.292 --> 00:14:02.583
What's wrong?

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:04.625
It's nothing...

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.000
He was a little snappy.

00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.458
Why isn't Gu Jae-yeon here yet?

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:14.476
I absolutely have to get
a picture with him today.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.625
He needs to get here soon.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.500
Oh, hey!

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:17.375
Over here.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.208
Oh, Jae-yeon.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.500
Jae-yeon.

00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:25.000
Jae-yeon, you doing okay?
What's with all the fame lately?

00:14:25.417 --> 00:14:26.667
What fame...

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:28.458
Hurry up and ask for a picture.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.667
No, seriously, my girlfriend
said she's a huge fan.

00:14:30.792 --> 00:14:32.101
I have to get a picture with you later.

00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:33.583
What're you saying?

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:34.708
That's true.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.143
You're finally getting close to Moon Do-ha,
so you've got to play your cards right.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.333
What nonsense.

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:39.208
Hey.

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:40.851
How does Moon Do-ha get
along with his group members?

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.583
Are they really on bad terms?

00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:50.542
Just kidding. I'm not curious at all.

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.500
You know I work at an agency, right?

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.167
I've seen way more
celebrities than you have.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:56.292
This place, too.

00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.897
It's a spot where production
company execs hang out, you know?

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.500
Is that so?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.042
Sir.

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:04.875
You didn't call the guys here, did you?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880
How long are you all
going to avoid each other?

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:09.250
During your trainee days,
weren't you all thick as thieves?

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.625
How did it come to this?

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.125
How should I know?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.417
Anyway, my only crime was working too hard.

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:16.875
I don't want to be
forced to meet like this.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.708
Young-woo, are you off work?

00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:22.333
I'm about to leave, too.

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:24.667
Yeah.

00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:26.000
See you at the office.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:27.958
Okay.

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:30.958
So why did you...

00:15:31.083 --> 00:15:32.583
You and that Gu Jae-yeon guy,

00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:34.833
have been creating a lot of buzz, right?

00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.625
Why are you bringing him up here?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.226
The closer you get to him, the more the
rumors about your group's conflict will grow.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.000
Don't you get it?

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.458
Moon Do-ha?

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:43.958
Huh?

00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:45.667
Are you on the phone?

00:15:45.792 --> 00:15:47.083
Hello?

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.167
Moon Do-ha.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.018
Is it okay if you just hang up like that?

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.250
How about you?

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:57.833
Who are you with?

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.958
Uh...

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:04.292
Don't a lot of celebrities come here?

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.333
Turns out you came with Shin Jun-ho.

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:08.500
- Who?
- Where is he?

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:10.917
I heard he's got great
proportions in person.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:15.583
No, I'm just... with my classmates.

00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:17.542
No, but...

00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:21.625
Why would I come to a
place like this with him?

00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:26.333
I heard you two are close.

00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.583
Close? We're not close.

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:32.917
We just worked together last year.

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:36.917
Really?

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:39.458
Yes.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:45.167
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go.

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:47.917
Um, well...

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.042
Did I say something wrong?

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:03.393
He's only getting some temporary buzz
thanks to Moon Do-ha.

00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:05.458
He'll be forgotten soon enough, right?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.792
Why are you so jealous?

00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:10.250
Enough. Stop talking and let's drink.

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:11.542
Cheers.

00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:16.833
Done with your call?

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.542
You're busy these days, huh?

00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:20.292
It's alright.

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.018
But our class has
produced a real celebrity.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:22.792
It's great.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.708
We finally have a celebrity among us.

00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:25.875
Hey now.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.500
A stunt actor doesn't count
as a celebrity, does he?

00:17:30.292 --> 00:17:31.125
Stop it.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.583
I'm right, aren't I?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.750
Do you guys think Gu
Jae-yeon is a celebrity?

00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:46.637
Have you said everything you wanted to say?

00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:49.917
Is that all you have to say?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Stop gossiping and talking behind my back.

00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:54.125
Hey!

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.125
Hey... that's enough.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.750
I couldn't stand you even back in school.

00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:02.435
Acting like you were doing something so
important, always coming back covered in injuries.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.559
Just to get the girls' attention.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.000
And it's the same today!
Usually, you're nowhere to be found.

00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:08.583
Why do you suddenly show
up the moment you get famous?

00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:11.500
Sorry, I'm leaving.

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:14.625
Are you happy being in the spotlight?

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:20.792
Of course, it's great.

00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:23.208
First off, I get more work, which is nice.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.792
Another benefit is...

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.500
it automatically filters
out the people in my life.

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:32.333
And lastly...

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.500
that idea that I got hurt
"just to get attention"...

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.875
where on earth did that even come from?

00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:42.708
Hey, Gu Jae-yeon!

00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.333
You think I know fewer
upperclassmen than you?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.000
Just stop!

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.125
What's your problem?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.542
Where should we go?

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.708
Well...

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:06.184
Weren't you the one who wanted to come out?

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:08.417
You came out without even
thinking of a place to go?

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:10.000
What about you?

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.667
Did you come out with
a destination in mind?

00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.208
You've probably eaten.

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.333
Let's skip the drinks.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.042
I don't drink.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.000
You don't drink?

00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:26.500
It only causes more trouble if I do.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:28.750
Oh...

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.458
What's with that reaction?

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.375
What about a cafe?

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:39.583
Pass.

00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:41.726
Going out would be a hassle
for you, right, Moon Do-ha?

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.167
Yeah.

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.625
Well then...

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.550
I guess that leaves just
one place we can go.

00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:01.167
