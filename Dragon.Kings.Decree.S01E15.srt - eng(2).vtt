=Episode 15=

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.340
Look at you.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.979
It's been hard for you.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.139
Now you know

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.020
Wujing can't compare
to Feng Manor, right?

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.659
You're right.

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.620
One wrong step,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.780
and your head might roll.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.620
It's not that serious.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.179
Are you saying

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.020
a bumpkin like me

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.899
have the Dragons behind my back?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.180
What I mean

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.300
is that they won't be your match.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.259
I will be with you no matter

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.220
where you go from now on.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.220
Well.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.658
Can I ask Fei Yuan and Bai Lu
to help me with something?

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.979
Anything at all.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.460
Ask away.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.460
I need their help

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.099
to find some precious herbs.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.620
As you wish.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:33.539
Mother,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.338
what did Liluo's physicians

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.139
do to Xiaoyu

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.699
and Zhilou?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.139
What did they do?

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.180
If those physicians can't cure mother,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.859
they're better off dead.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.419
You're the Wujing Saintess.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.020
Your every action
represents Wujing City.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.939
How could you treat human lives
like dirt?

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.960
If the Dragons find out,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.818
how will they trust that a marriage alliance
with you can save the world?

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:58.900
Enough.

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.139
Are you questioning your sister

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.778
or me?

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:04.579
Mother.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.899
If Liluo can't become the Dragon Queen,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.780
I can't be cured!

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:30.379
You've been eating the whole way
and you're still at it.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.940
You're so annoying.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.619
You're going to eat yourself
to death one day.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.619
In ancient times,
Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs.

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:40.179
Now, you have me who can eat anything.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.700
It's nice!

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.298
Here, Xiaoyu.

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:53.539
Eat more.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.858
Darn you, Xiaoyu.

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:56.020
Taking Zhilou all to yourself!

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.418
(Thank you)

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.139
(for doing so much for me.)

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.340
(I can never repay you.)

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:09.059
There's no need to thank me.

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.459
Besides, I still need your help

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.338
to figure out a cure

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.780
for City Lord.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.899
After all,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.739
you know her condition the best.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.619
I read

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.298
all your medical texts
the past few days.

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:20.780
They're very detailed.

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:21.619
The solution's

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.780
right in there.

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.260
(What's the solution?)

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.019
Her Lordship's poison

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.619
has entered her core.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.299
To save her live,

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.619
we must purify her blood.

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.780
She's unwilling?

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.979
What if she will die?

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:51.459
Right, Zhilou.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.098
I've been meaning to ask.

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.098
How can you understand

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.418
what Xiaoyu is saying

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.859
with her hand waving around like that?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.098
My uncle and I have treated
a family born deaf and mute.

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.658
I learned it back then.

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.019
As expected of you.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.299
You can do anything.

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.780
You have some more too.

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:08.900
Here.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.299
Have a thigh.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.780
Thank you.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.338
(Youyun Pavilion)

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.539
Look, Xiaoyu.

00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:30.900
Is this the medicine for Her Lordship?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.659
You can't just eat this stuff.

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.179
Stop eating it.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.218
I told you to stop.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.020
What am I going to use to treat Her Lordship?

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:16.899
I hope you understand, Dragon Prince.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.659
Illnesses vary in severity and urgency.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.299
You needn't worry.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.220
I am here merely
to check on your condition

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:24.419
and to inform you

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:26.778
that the Saintess' inspection ritual
can be postponed

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.659
until you've recovered.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.659
Thank you for understanding, Prince.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.800
Wishing you speedy recovery.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.979
I'll take my leave.

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.220
Your Highness, wait.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.340
Your Highness,

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.780
would you care to have lunch with me?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.659
To be honest,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.460
I'm very worried

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:48.780
about Mother's sudden illness.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.299
I would love to have your advice.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.020
(Apothecary)

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.280
This is a restricted area.
Unauthorized entry is forbidden.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.720
We have been ordered to treat Her Lordship
and need to go inside to brew the medicine.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.260
You're not a physician.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:09.658
(We really are here)

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:11.499
(to treat Her Lordship.)

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.940
Insolence!

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:19.899
How dare you obstruct
Miss Feng and Physician Chu?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.820
Young Lord.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.940
I waited here for you

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:27.940
to give you this token.

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:30.820
If you run into any trouble
in Wujing City,

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.499
my token will be useful.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.180
Thank you.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.180
Xiaoyu,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.820
how are you feeling?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.899
Liluo was just worried about Mother,
and her temper flared up.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.259
You suffered because of it.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.060
Let's go.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:20.660
I'm worried

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.219
if Mother's illness drags on,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.899
will the inspection ritual have
to be postponed endlessly?

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:27.739
It is an important ritual.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.700
The Wujing City Lord must be present.

00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:33.259
I also hope that Mother

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:35.019
can watch me become the Saintess

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:37.460
and walk hand-in-hand with Your Highness

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.700
from War God's Hall to the sanctuary.

00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:42.460
These two matters

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.899
have kept me up at night.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.940
I don't know what to do.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.379
The world's best physicians

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:50.580
are working tirelessly to cure Her Lordship.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.700
She will surely recover soon.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.779
If there is nothing else,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.660
I'll take my leave now.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:02.339
Quick!

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.779
Summon Chu Xiaoyu.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.458
Yes.

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:05.778
And Feng Zhilou too.

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.940
Bring both of them to me now!

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:11.019
Quick.

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:12.700
Your Highness.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.139
This is a century-old sandalwood,

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.979
and inside is a sachet I made myself.

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:23.938
I was worried

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:25.499
Wujing is too crude

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.619
and can't compare
to the beautiful sanctuary.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.019
If it has affected your sleep
or appetite,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.580
you can place this by your bed.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.499
It has a calming effect.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.420
Your Grace, you have been worried.

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:38.300
You should keep it for yourself.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.499
I was presumptuous.

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.300
The Dragon Prince

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:46.220
wouldn't need something like this
of the humans.

00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:51.499
Your Grace, her lordship's
illness struck suddenly.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.560
She's in unbearable pain
and coughed up a lot of blood.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.060
This way.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.178
It hurts.

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:01.460
Quickly.

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:03.298
Quickly.

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:04.339
Quick.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.619
It hurts so much!

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:06.660
Quick.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.178
My lord, this new medicine
that Feng Zhilou prepared is said

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:26.019
to neutralize the toxins in your blood

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.300
and ease the pain.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.460
How do you

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:29.940
feel right now?

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.779
It does feel much better.

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:37.619
It worked.

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:40.060
The medicine Fei Yuan found
really worked.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.460
We're on the right track.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.379
Mother,

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.460
the Dragon Prince has come to visit you.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.379
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.340
Your Grace,

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:56.019
her lordship feels much better

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.460
after having the new medicine.

00:11:57.939 --> 00:11:59.899
Dragon Prince,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.019
thank you

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.538
for your trouble

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:05.460
in coming in today.

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:07.899
This is great, Mother.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.178
It seems the medicine

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:10.779
is effective.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:12.938
This way, my wedding with Prince Shang

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:14.460
won't be delayed for too long.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.340
Your Highness,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.979
the worry in my heart

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.259
has finally eased.

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.499
I wish Mother

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.259
can recover tomorrow,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.379
and we can hold
the inspection ritual the day after.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.460
So I can become your bride

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:33.499
and help you

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:35.820
with your worries and troubles.

00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:58.379
Zhilou.

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:00.859
Who are you?

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.739
The Wujing Princess.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:05.499
The Saintess.

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:07.019
Your Highness?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.700
Prince Shang?

00:13:09.699 --> 00:13:11.460
If I'm not mistaken,

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:13.660
you're not a normal dragon.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.540
You're the supreme,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.139
unmatched prince

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.859
of the Dragons.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.019
You and the daughter
of the Wujing City Lord,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.540
Princess Liluo,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.298
have long been betrothed.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.220
Miss,

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:01.460
who is this?

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:04.180
My mother.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.300
She has beautiful eyes.

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:09.180
I've been here for so long

00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:11.660
but haven't found any news of her.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:13.660
Miss,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.779
don't be sad.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.778
I think

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:17.820
the Young Master
looks at you differently.

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:19.458
Don't you humans

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:21.339
call it a white lie?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.099
He must have a reason
to hide his identity.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.578
Don't fight with him.

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:26.298
Don't be mad.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:27.899
Don't break up, okay?

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.139
I only like seeing you
with the Dragon God.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.940
Hunbao,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.899
the lie may be false,

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.060
but if it touched the heart,

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:43.019
it's no different from the truth.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.019
So

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:47.300
whether if it's a white lie

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.940
or a malicious one,

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:51.259
it still hurts the sincere heart.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.420
Perhaps

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.859
the high and mighty Dragons

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.899
are never at fault.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.499
Miss,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.259
I don't understand.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.899
Can you explain it plainly?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.499
It's my fault.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:11.820
Zhilou.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.139
I know you're still up.

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:18.340
I want to talk to you.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.580
Miss,

00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:20.818
if you don't want to see him,

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.139
I'll chase him out.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.779
Miss,

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:31.700
you're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.580
And how many have you met?

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.619
What is it?

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.099
What're you doing?

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.940
You...

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:01.420
Chu Moshang,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.779
you kept me from treating City Lord

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.220
because you were afraid
this would happen, weren't you?

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.499
Afraid that one day I would

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:10.420
see your true colors.

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:11.499
I was wrong

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.139
to lie

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.300
and hide my identity.

00:16:13.819 --> 00:16:15.339
But I severely injured

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.418
when we first met,

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:17.940
and my sigil was with you.

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:19.458
We were mere strangers,

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:20.619
and I was in danger.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.820
How could I reveal my identity easily?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.619
Mere strangers?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.300
I thought after all we've been through,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.578
we could talk about anything

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:31.739
and have no secrets.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.019
That's not what I meant.

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:36.259
You had so many chances

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.139
and the time to tell me

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.058
your true identity.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:40.619
You could've told me

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.099
you came to Wujing City

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.458
to fulfill your marriage

00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:44.899
with the Wujing Saintess,

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:47.180
but you kept silent the entire time!

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:53.060
You're right.

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:54.899
I hesitated.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.739
I didn't know how to tell you.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.180
Fine.

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:00.540
I'll tell you

00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:03.019
why exactly.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.299
It because I, Feng Zhilou,

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.180
am a loser illegitimate daughter

00:17:07.739 --> 00:17:08.579
while you

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.019
are the Dragon God I worshipped.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.900
It was my honor

00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:15.579
to just have met you.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.900
The difference between us

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.539
is night and day!

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.899
I never once thought of you

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.380
as a lowly illegitimate daughter.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.218
Do you truly believe that?

00:17:24.219 --> 00:17:25.420
Or do you

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.100
just view our relationship
as a contract?

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.779
I treated your poison.

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:31.660
You opened my spiritual root.

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:33.460
It's a win-win situation.

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:34.458
Great.

00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:35.900
Most importantly,

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.819
I'm probably

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.978
just a temporary jewelry box

00:17:38.979 --> 00:17:40.779
for you to store the sigil.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.899
The sigil was forged
with my reverse scale.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.059
It's not as simple

00:17:44.219 --> 00:17:46.100
as wearing jewelry on your hand.

00:17:46.459 --> 00:17:48.059
Then you must think

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.019
you're the Dragon Prince.

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:51.220
In the future,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.059
you'll marry the Wujing Saintess.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.698
You both will become one

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:55.738
while I am just

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:59.218
a passerby who shamelessly pursued you
and insisted on a fake marriage.

00:17:59.219 --> 00:18:00.259
That's not it.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.180
You're incredibly important to me.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.059
No matter how hard I try,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.940
how much I improve my cultivation,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.900
how successful I become,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.978
I can never reach

00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:15.940
the exalted Dragon God.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.739
You actually had no obligation

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.299
to tell me who you are.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.019
I shouldn't be angry.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.140
I was only angry

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.059
because I realized my absurdity

00:18:31.499 --> 00:18:33.900
and incompetence.

This jade pendant is formed

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.539
I gave it to you willingly.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.019
You gave me too many precious things.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.539
I'm unworthy of them.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.059
This jade pendant

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.979
