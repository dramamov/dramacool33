I told you
to wear clothes at home, too.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.870
I refuse.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.970
Gosh.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.900
I told you not to leave toothpaste stains
on your lips around me.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.600
Do you want to be kissed?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:38.800
Gosh!

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.070
Come out quickly!

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.980

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.750
Three years ago,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.970
during what I thought was
the biggest slump of my life,

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.220
like a miracle...

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.000
I met my first love.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:08.720
He's a little taller than I am
and gentle—

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.770
my boyfriend.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:25.020
[Thank you for the times we shared—
as sweet as a peach's fragrance.]

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:17.620
[Stay tuned for the epilogue]

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.580
[Peach Trap]

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.370
Let go of all distractions for now.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.700
Just focus on your body and your opponent.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.620
But, did you know?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.700
Jiu-jitsu is a sport

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.100
you need a partner for.
