[The Sparrow's Gambit]

[Episode 8]

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620
This affair ends now

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.660
in your own room!

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.340
I think

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.860
you know

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.300
why Wang Wan'er invited you.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.460
You don't wanna marry her, right?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860
You're looking for Qingmao, right?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.660
Listen.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.060
Work with me.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.820
I'll tell you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380
how the Wangs killed her.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500
Do as you please.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.620
You wretch!

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.020
Stop right there!

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860
Anger doesn't suit your beauty.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.260
Liu Rumeng!

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.460
How dare you seduce Wenbin?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.100
At the Paramount,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.340
all guests are welcome.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.820
Wenbin

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.260
is no exception.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.700
You've been playing me all along?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.420
Unlike you, Miss Wang,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.060
you annoyed him with all your schemes.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.220
It's a bother for me

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.980
that I did nothing

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.060
yet Wenbin keeps pursuing me.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.060
The Blycher Hotel.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.620
The Paramount.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.420
Even in your room.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.260
He's so bold.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.620
Every time,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.860
right under your nose.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.420
It's thrilling,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.140
really.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.100
You're such a good friend to me.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.180
You always do what I say,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180
in business and life.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020
The lost shipment,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.820
today's party disaster, all of it.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.820
I'm so worried about you.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.780
You did this

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.460
on purpose, right?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.060
Liu Rumeng,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.260
our opium

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.460
is in your hands, right?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.820
What?

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.740
The Wangs were secretly

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.820
transporting opium?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.660
Scared?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.660
Without you,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.940
we wouldn't need

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.380
investment from the Chamber

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.620
to cover the opium loss.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.220
Hand over

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.060
the opium now.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.980
Or I'll

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.420
burn the Paramount down.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.860
Don't cross the Wang family.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.260
I never thought

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.420
you could be so vile!

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.260
Aren't you afraid of karma?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.620
Karma?

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.620
Where is it?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.260
I don't see it!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.460
You're not the first ghost

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.820
our Wangs have made!

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.460
Miss Wang is a murderer!

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.580
Stop filming!

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.860
Stop!

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.620
I'll kill you all!

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.340
Enough!

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.180
Dad.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.020
I can let her go.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.820
But you cover the debt.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.660
Yes, yes!

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.820
I have one last opium batch.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.940
Just grant me dock access,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.700
and I'll repay you, I swear!

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.300
Be smart. No next time.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.700
Dad!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.700
What is it?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.940
Speak! What happened?

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.260
We...

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.820
We're expelled from the Chamber.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.860
And...

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.420
No dock will take our goods.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.780
You dare face me?

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.820
Don't you know

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.660
why we're in this mess?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.820
I told you explicitly

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.500
to keep our business secret!

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.660
But you just wouldn't listen!

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.820
You ignored my words!

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.140
If I hadn't stopped you,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.700
would you have

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.860
blabbed about my past, too?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.700
You'll be the death of me!

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.580
No!

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.660
It wasn't me, Dad!

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.700
It's Liu Rumeng! All her doing!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.260
Liu Rumeng! Liu Rumeng!

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.660
She played you for a fool!

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.100
If you had half her wits,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.460
you wouldn't be...

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.700
Get out!

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.380
Liu Rumeng.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.900
You came alone.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.660
Aren't you afraid?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.900
I've done nothing wrong.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.060
Why should I be afraid?

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.140
Good.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.980
You have some nerve.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.100
Now give me one reason

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.820
not to kill you.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.220
There's a misunderstanding between us.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.300
What misunderstanding?

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.380
Miss Wang's effort to fix business flaws

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.660
were found by the Marshal.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.220
I tried to help fix it,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.700
which made her jealous.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.820
That caused all this.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.060
I overstepped.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.500
So I came here

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.620
to apologize.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.660
Apologize?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.060
Besides the Paramount,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.260
I own a dock in Song City.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.460
How did you know

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.260
I need a dock right now?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.020
This is all I own.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.420
I'll pay any price

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.460
for a chance to live.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.460
I have a shipment.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.460
I'll use your dock.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.460
And you'll oversee it personally,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.260
and bring it back intact.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.380
That is your final chance.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.500
Deal.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.660
Liu Rumeng, I will make you pay.
