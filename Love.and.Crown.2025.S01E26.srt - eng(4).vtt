once risked his life

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.020

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.940
for the sake

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.330

I know you care about Xiao Ying.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.410
But indulging her

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.090
isn't truly loving her.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.460
I understand.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.330
As for this matter,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.210
I won't just let it slide.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.650
Why did Xiao Ying change so suddenly?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.380
Why did she never show any sign before?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.260
I believe

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.330
none of this is a coincidence.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.850
There must be someone

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.380
pulling the strings behind her.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.730
I will get to the bottom of this.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.970
Even if it was my mother who ordered it,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.090

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.260
Good.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.060

Ying,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.530
what is going on?

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.460
Li Hongqing is just a guard commander.

Why would you seek revenge for him?

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.500
Has someone been filling your head

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.530
and leading you astray?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.530
This must all be Xiao Huan again!

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.700
It's his plot!

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.260

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.060

And the baby...

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.850
could not be saved.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.020
Sir...

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.620
Sir!

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.140
Your Majesty,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.170
the Imperial Father-in-law is in trouble.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.140
Your Majesty,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.380
the Imperial Father-in-law suddenly collapsed.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.530
How is he now?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.530
He's awake now,

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.620
but... not doing well.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.700
Is everyone at Fayun Temple useless?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.620
For now, don't tell the Empress.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.330
Her body can't take any more.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.090
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.770
Bring Ling Xuefeng back to the Capital.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.730
Find him the best imperial physician.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.090
Do everything you can to save him.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.770
If anything goes wrong,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.730
at least let father and daughter

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.330
see each other one last time.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.460
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.140
Qianqing,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.330
what did His Majesty say about this?

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.820
Will he have Ying executed?

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.460
Ying,

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.090
tell me the truth.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.500
Did someone egg you on

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.770
to try

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.860
to assassinate His Majesty?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.930
You don't need to ask her.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.050
She's still not herself.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.500
I'll have someone send calming soup

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.100
so she can get some real rest.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.500
This time,

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.690
you were wrong.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.170
When you do something wrong,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.930
there is always a price to pay.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.620
Qianqing, what are you saying?

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.980
I wanted to pay that price for you.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.100
But His Majesty is right.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.530
Always indulging you...

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.860
is not truly loving you.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.100
Qianqing...

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.260
the flower is about to bloom...

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.380
The flower is about to bloom...

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.650
The flower is about to bloom...

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.620
Qianqing,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.980
what are you doing?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.040
I've cut her inner channels.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.190
She can never refine poison again.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.460
Qianqing,

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.740
are you out of your mind?

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.650
I'm not!

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.930
I was the one running away before.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.140
Ying had a miserable childhood.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.100
No one ever taught her right from wrong.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.140
But in this world,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.050
no one can spoil her forever.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.980
Ying...

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.380
forgive me...

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.770
forgive your brother.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.860
Qianqing!

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.050
Xiao Qianqing!

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.260
Ying...

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.570
it's all right.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.290
It's all right now.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.410
From now on,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.860
you can't make poison.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.380
I'll keep you company in other ways.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.260
I will always...

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.770
always stay by your side.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.410
Xiao Qianqing,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.500
tell me,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.500
are you afraid of Wuying Hall now?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.050
Mother,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.260
did you

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.290
have anything to do with this?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.570
What did you say?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.690
Did you order Ying

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.100
to try to assassinate His Majesty?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.220
Is this how you speak to your mother?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.530
In this palace,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.050
who but you would dare think that way?

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.220
Yes!

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.620
I wish he would just die right now!

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.170
But...

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.810
do you really think

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.530
I would send Ying to do it?

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.340
Her mind is not sound.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.650
She is beyond my control.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.290
If anything went wrong,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.570
Xiao Huan would suspect me first!

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.450
Why would I set myself on fire?

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.500
And if Xiao Huan survived,

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.690
I,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.980
the whole Liu clan,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.170
and you included,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.690
would all be buried with her!

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.980
And today,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.980
you question me for Xiao Huan's sake.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.810
Qianqing,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.690
has your heart

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.970
already turned to him?

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.020
Have you forgotten

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.980
the humiliation I suffered back then

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.410
and how coldly I was treated?

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.580
[Prince of Yuzhang's Manor]

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.220
Xiao Qianqing,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.770
I'm back!

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:54.690
Zhong Lin!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.930
I found it!

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.500
This method really works?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.450
It has to work.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.930
Though Gold Incense is colorless and tasteless,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.290
the red flying ants that grow on dead branches

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.690
of thousand-year-old golden nanmu

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.930
will swarm straight to it.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.050
They can sniff it out even from ten zhang away.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.220
I managed to get two of them.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.220
We can give it a try.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.450
You've really helped me a lot this time.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.740
If we can prove my mother is innocent,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.530
I'll make sure she credits you with great merit.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.380
I'm not doing this for your mother.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.020
I'm doing it for you and Ying,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.620
and for Cangcang.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.340
Her baby is just gone.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.980
Whoever is behind this,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.570
I'll drag them out into the light.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.980
The Emperor just lost his temper.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.530
His anger at you

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.810
was just anger at himself.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.530
Once we catch the culprit,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.290
things will work out.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.450
I know.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.170
Besides,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.770
even if he keeps his distance from you,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.980
you still have me.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.290
Right?

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.410
Zhong Lin,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.170
if one day I leave this place

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.530
and never return,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.930
who would you choose

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.860
between Ling Cangcang and me?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.410
If Cangcang is safe and happy,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.380
that's all I wish for.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.860
As for me,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.500
of course I'll go wherever you go.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.410
I go where my man goes!

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.380
Your Majesty.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.380
In the future,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.340
Ying can never refine poisons again.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.060
The venomous insect she used this time

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.930
is called Dual-Pupil.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.650
It can rapidly draw out a person's inner power,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.100
but it does severe damage to the mind.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.860
Right now,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.340
Ying only recognizes me.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.690
Whatever I say,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.650
she doesn't really understand.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.010
I can't get any answers out of her.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.340
But on the day she attacked,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.300
her mind was clear.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.100
That's what Dual-Pupil does.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.410
Once it forces out all your potential

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.930
and unleashes your power,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.250
you quickly become dull and witless.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.170
Your Majesty,

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.300
though my mother raised Ying,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.970
she would never make her

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.690
use a secret art that ruins her own body.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.750
If my mother chose to use Ying,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.410
she'd be setting herself on fire.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.140
She's not that foolish.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.380
I truly believe

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.250
the one pulling Ying's strings

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.650
must be someone else.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.970
I will find them.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.690
But Xiao Ying can't say anything now.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.380
How will you find them?

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.540
She finished

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.730
breeding this insect long ago.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.490
She even bragged about it to me.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.250
But to get this kind of insect into the body,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.780
you have to take Gold Incense

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.340
for several days in a row.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.010
This stuff is highly addictive.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.300
It's worth a fortune.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.930
It's contraband.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.730
It should never appear

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.580
inside the palace.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.730
So you already have a plan?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.410
Within five days,

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.450
I will get to the bottom of this

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.580
and give you an answer.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.740
[Upright and Honorable]

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.010
Sir, please don't be angry.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.770
We've been setting this up for so long,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.180
and Xiao Huan is still alive.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.860
On top of that,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.570
I've even lost a grandchild I never met.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.490
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.660
But you use this chance to return to the Capital.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.290
And I've helped you quite a bit.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.460
Now that you're back,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.860
we can finally aim for bigger things.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.560
I've already lost my grandchild.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.330
I just want to go back

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.500
and see my daughter.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.170
Are you thinking of backing out?

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.380
Don't forget:

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.380
the Empress losing her child

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.980
was partly your doing.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.180
Do you really think you still have a way out?

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.860
Commander of the Capital Patrol Office,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.570
Zhang Heng,

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.570
please come out.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.140
I heard you two have never gotten along.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.490
Because of you,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.460
Mr. Zhang was demoted three ranks.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.980
He had to start over as a lowly clerk in the North City Patrol

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.220
before climbing back up to commander.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.770
And even as commander,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.220
he gave you no end of trouble.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.940
Years ago, he stopped your carriage,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.090
saying you were too extravagant

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.220
that your carriage exceeded your rank.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.770
If Sir had really wanted to make things hard for me,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.570
could I have risen safely to commander?

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.090
The one playing the game

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.580
will sometimes place a hidden piece.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.860
And that hidden piece

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.840
often sits at the most critical spot.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.010
Truly,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.290
he is a masterful piece.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.120
Right now,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.990
I've turned the key hidden piece

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.220
face up for you to see.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.590
Do you still think

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.590
I would back down?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.550
General Lu,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.420
let me remind you of one thing:

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.240
the Imperial Preceptor is sacred and untouchable.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.820
The last Imperial Preceptor had a secret affair

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.660
and I personally carried out

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.810
her sentence of death by fire.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.570
Inside here are red flying ants.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.660
They love the scent of Gold Incense.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.810
If someone has come into contact with it,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.940
even a dozen days later,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.420
the red flying ants can still sniff it out.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.940
This register lists everyone

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.330
who has entered or left the cold palace recently.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.980
Once we test them with the ants,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.940
the one behind it all is sure to be exposed.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.540
[Cold Palace Entry Log]

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.570
Wufu.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.350
Yes.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.990
Summon Lu Qi.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:28.850
Yes.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.900
Wait.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.570
Why isn't Lu Qi's name

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.180
on this register?

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.770
He's Li Hongqing's right-hand man.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.620
That doesn't make sense.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.600
He could've had contact with Xiao Ying too.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.380
That day, the situation in Wuying Hall was deadly dangerous.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.020
Yet he showed up late,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.530
saying he'd suddenly taken ill.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.900
How could it be such a coincidence?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.770
Lu's family has been loyal for generations.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.660
He's an upright man,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.090
even a bit stubborn.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.050
It's hard to believe he'd be bought off.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.060
We'll know

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.240
as soon as we test him.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.420
Summon Lu Qi!

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.010
Yes.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.980
That's roughly what happened

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.700
in the cold palace that day.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.490
It was my failure in duty.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.380
I didn't notice anything unusual about the princess.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.980
It's not your fault.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.010
Any news of Li Hongqing?

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.140
None yet.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.980
I've sent more men

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.530
to search for Commander Li.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.810
All right.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.380
You may go for now.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.770
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.810
Put someone on him.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.620
Check everyone

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.490
he came into contact with.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.420
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.730
Your Majesty,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.290
I'll look into this myself.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.140
I want to see who's really behind this,

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.770
whether they're man or ghost.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.730
Your Majesty,

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.730
is something weighing on your mind?

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.180
Here,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.540
have a candied fruit.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.010
Your Majesty,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.290
have you found the real culprit

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.360
behind the princess?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.860
We have a lead,

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.620
but nothing is certain yet.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.810
You said

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.330
you would never keep anything from me.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.940
All right.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.220
I promise you

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.810
I won't hide anything.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.980
But you have to rest

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.090
and fully regain your strength.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.140
Otherwise, how can I feel at ease

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.900
telling you all these troubles?

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.730
I'm almost fully recovered.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.980
Even Physician Li says so.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.730
I can run and jump now.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.010
See for yourself...

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.010
All right!

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:13.860
I know.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.460
I know you're back on your feet.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.530
Promise me

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.220
that whatever happens,

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.090
we'll face it together.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.730
All right.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.860
General Lu.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:44.810
Open the gate.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.140
Your Highness.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.010
Open the gate.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.600
Trinkets!

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.200
Trinkets! Take a look!

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.010
Kites! Have a look!

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.700
Take a look!

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.620
Mother,

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.940
which of these two

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.730
looks better?

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.590
Wrap them up.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.380
- Got it. - Ladies.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.140
Take your time and look around.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.730
Not bad.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.180
Sir, another bowl!

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.730
Miss, have a look.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.250
How did Zhang Heng, commander of the Capital Patrol Office,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.010
and Lu Qi, deputy commander of the Imperial Guards,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.460
end up together like that?

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.380
[Imperial Assembly Patrol]

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980
[Lu Qi, deputy commander of the Imperial Guards]

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.100
[Zhang Heng, commander of the Capital Patrol Office]

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.010
The Imperial Assembly patrol

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.860
was always handled by Li Hongqing.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.730
Now,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.290
his fate is unknown

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.380
and he still hasn't returned.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.460
So the duty has fallen to Lu Qi and Zhang Heng.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.490
Someone's plotting something at the Imperial Assembly?

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.810
But who is behind it all?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.090
Lu Qi was the one

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.220
who escorted Ling Xuefeng back.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.010
You mean

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.730
Ling Xuefeng still won't give up his ambitions?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.530
But Zhang Heng has always been his sworn enemy.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.730
That's why I trusted him so deeply

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.050
and put the Capital's defenses in his hands.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.220
But thinking about it now,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.730
if Ling Xuefeng really wanted to block him,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.090
how did Zhang Heng

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.570
rise so smoothly to commander?

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.980
Could Zhang Heng

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.620
have been Ling Xuefeng's secret piece all along?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.180
So,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.420
from Shi Yan's incident,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.330
to Li Hongqing leaving the palace,

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.500
to Xiao Ying's attack,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.620
and even Zhang Heng and Lu Qi colluding now,

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.780
it was all within his design.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.050
If this really is Ling Xuefeng's work,

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.620
his scheming runs too deep

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.180
for anyone to see through.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.530
I'll go arrest Zhang Heng and Lu Qi right away,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.180
then find a way to call off the Imperial Assembly.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.220
No need.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:22.140
I want to see

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.330
what he plans to do

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.530
at the assembly five days from now.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.140
[Linghe Hall]

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.420
Your Majesty.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.700
It's so late.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.620
Why are you still up?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.090
I just saw Zhong Lin and Luo.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.810
Luo said

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.490
you told Zhong Lin to bring him here.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.050
Luo Xianxue helped Hongqing save Shi Yan.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.700
I think

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.770
he did it all for you.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.940
Calling them into the palace now,

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.770
what for?

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.620
I want them to protect you.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.770
Since what happened to Hongqing,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.730
there are so few people in the palace I can trust.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.980
I believe

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.330
the two of them

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.250
would risk their lives to guard you.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.220
Your Majesty,

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:26.860
I'm so scared...

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.050
He really

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.460
still hasn't given up?

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.380
As long as I'm here,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.010
he won't succeed.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.900
What do you plan

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.620
to do with him?

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.620
Ling Xuefeng's crimes

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.620
are unforgivable.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.700
I will never spare him.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.380
But rest assured,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.090
the innocent

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.010
will not be dragged down.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.820
[Wuying Hall]

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.260
[Wuying Hall]

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.820
Everything is ready.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.260
If we fail,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.460
we die trying!

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.050
All officials of the Imperial Assembly, enter the hall

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.460
and pay respects to His Majesty!

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.420
Proceed!

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.260
At the dawn of a new year,

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.130
all things are made new.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.340
We pray Your Majesty

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.130
receive Heaven's blessing

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.260
and share in its glory!

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.980
Stow your tablets!

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.300
Kneel!

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.860
All hail!

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.940
Long live Your Majesty!

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.420
You may all rise!

Present your tablets!

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.980
By Your Majesty's grace,

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.340
in the ninth year of Yongxi, Great Qi is rich and strong.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.780
In the southern provinces, the land is fertile and the waters full.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.740
Though we faced locust plague,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.050
the damage was slight.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.780
Every home has grain stored.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.340
The people are all well fed.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.420
At best, fields yield two dan of grain per mu.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.420
As for the remaining details,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.860
[Memorial]
I've set them out in full

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.780
for Your Majesty's review.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.340
Such prosperity

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.650
is thanks to all you ministers.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.260
What Great Qi seeks

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.690
is not short-term gain.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.090
I hope you will all work as one,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.420
abolish outdated rules,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.460
and push forward new policies.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.940
Let the brave know righteousness,

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.300
and the wise cherish benevolence.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.980
We will heed your teachings!

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.460
Imperial Preceptor Du has prepared Tusu wine for everyone.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.460
Let's all raise a toast

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.650
to Great Qi's future,

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.860
with fair winds and timely rain,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.090
and a peaceful, prosperous people!

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.610
How could this cup of wine

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.610
possibly go

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.380
without me?

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.780
Ling Xuefeng,

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.940
you dare commit treason!

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.090
So you've been planning this for a long time, Sir.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.780
Since you've come today,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.780
I'm sure

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.690
you have plenty to say.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.650
Of course.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.100
Today I came

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:13.890
to ask just one thing:

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.840
Without the full support

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.390
of the Ling clan and me,

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.170
what right or ability did you have

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.150
to sit securely on the throne?

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.690
So,

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.930
you want to take it for yourself?

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.610
I have no wish to usurp you.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.160
But I have already received an imperial edict.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.940
It states His Majesty is gravely ill with a cold illness,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.750
and thus

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.900
he has passed the throne to the prince in the Empress's womb.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.110
He orders me to bear the imperial seal,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.910
ascend to the Taiji Hall,

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.380
assist the new emperor,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.170
share in handling state affairs,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.960
and oversee the realm and armies.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.820
This minister

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.430
dares not refuse.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.940
Why didn't I know

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.390
about this edict?

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.660
Because...

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.090
during today's court session,

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.960
you will suddenly be taken ill

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.530
and die.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.860
You're that sure

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.860
everything will go your way today?

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.130
The hearts of men are with me.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.420
Good.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.610
Very good.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.680
So,

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.380
you'd planned ahead all along.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.190
I've already spent the night

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.330
replacing the Imperial Guards with my own men.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.860
In fact, I could've taken down

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.740
the Capital Patrol commander earlier.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:38.940
But...

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.090
I wanted to see

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.170
just how many people in this court

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.900
truly stand

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.420
on your side.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.490
Now that you've seen it for yourself,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.190
allow me

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.050
to send Your Majesty on your way.
