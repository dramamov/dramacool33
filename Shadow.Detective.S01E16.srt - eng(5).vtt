Here.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.590
Wipe your hands.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.690
You must be thirsty.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.240
Here, have some water.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.610
This cup is unused.

Are you in cahoots with Zhuo Chaoxiong?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.640
I didn't kill anyone.

I really didn't kill anyone.

Years ago, a girl escaped,

Is she still alive?

Alright.

There are three paths.

You and I will each take one.

You know full well that I'm Lu Jialei.

What are you afraid of?

Officer Lu, your guy is here.

Dr. Gu, you're here.

I'm really sorry

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.920
for making you
come all the way here so late.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.270
It's fine. Inspector Guan asked for
my help,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.390
so I have to help.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.800
It's him, right?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.870
Inspector Guan

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.630
already told me about
his condition on the phone.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.510
How is he now?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.830
He keeps repeating the same thing
over and over

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.310
and shows aggressive behavior.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.720
He only calmed down

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.680
when I bandaged him.

Where can I buy some food then?

Could you check around
the neighborhood for me

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.360
and see if there's a place to buy food?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.960
I'm so sorry for the trouble.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.610
Alright.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.870
What happened?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.150
Who was taken to the hospital?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.550
We just rescued a survivor.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.610
She's been taken to the hospital now.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.690
Come on, let's go check on her.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.180
Can't you get some rest?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.740
Whatever happens,
the two of us can handle it.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.570
I said you should rest...

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.420
I... you should rest...

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.630
From now on, no matter what happens,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.030
I'm staying by your side.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.960
Alright, I know.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.550
You...

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.480
Slow down, Guan Cen.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.200
The nurse just cleaned her up a bit.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.270
She looks to be
only around 16 to 18 years old.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.320
Physically, she's not in bad shape,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.900
but she is a bit malnourished.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.470
And due to multiple childbirths,
there has been...

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.800
Multiple childbirths?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.320
How is that possible?
She's barely even 18.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.150
Anyway,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.720
some of her organ functions
show signs of deterioration.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.750
We need to keep her under observation
for a while.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.480
The thing is,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.080
she refuses to speak,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.720
so we don't dare
administer medication carelessly.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.580
One more thing:

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.240
be careful when you visit her.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.440
In her current condition,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.480
she shouldn't meet too many strangers.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.500
We don't know what might trigger her,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.440
which could be harmful to her health.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.480
Alright, doctor.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.460
Let her rest quietly then.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:07.900
Thank you for your help.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.920
Should we get Dr. Gu?

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.930
No, we can't.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.109
What's wrong?

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.040
Dr. Gu was also seriously injured.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.750
You should let him rest.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.490
This matter can wait a bit.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.310
If I can find that survivor,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.020
then I might find more survivors.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.760
Maybe Jingning is still alive.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.510
Thank you.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.240
Where's Du Linfeng?

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.470
He said he's going to the hospital
to get more information.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.160
You know what?

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.330
I always see Jingning in my dreams.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.940
She's still so little.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.070
Running around carefree
at the temple fair.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.580
She holds candied haws in one hand

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.750
and points at

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.240
the dancing dragon with the other.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.120
She shouts happily at me,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.680
"Brother.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.450
Brother."

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.400
When I first started having these dreams,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.080
I was actually quite happy.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.590
I'd immerse myself in the dreams...

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.120
and even that happiness

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.110
would continue after I woke up.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.530
It was like a form of self-numbing.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.780
But as the dreams became more frequent,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.710
I became more aware

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.710
and more devastated.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.970
In the dreams, I'd scream.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.280
I'd just keep screaming.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:28.680
I refused to sleep.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.750
I felt like this was heaven's

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.920
punishment for me.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.590
I'm a detective.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.730
Every day, I uncover the truth for others.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.680
Yet I can't even find my own sister.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.940
You know,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720
when I was little,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.570
there was a time
I was terrified of the dark—

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.130
so scared I couldn't sleep.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.960
Then my dad would sit at my bedside

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.830
and tell me

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.590
how beautiful

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.930
and how luminous the night was.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.020
Darkness doesn't only exist at night.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.240
It's the backdrop of all beautiful things.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.960
Guan Cen.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.520
It's just dark now.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.480
There will be

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.480
strong winds and heavy rain at night,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.090
but the sun will always rise again.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.200
I'll wait with you...

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.440
for daybreak.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.250
None of you can leave tonight!

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.440
Let's drink till we drop!

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.270
Let's keep drinking!

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.350
-Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.610
Bartender, drinks, drinks for all of us.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.500
Pour me a drink.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:24.870
Excuse me,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.600
this bottle of whisky
belongs to this gentleman.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.160
The whisky I pour is my whisky.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.510
He should be honored
I'm drinking his whisky.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.830
Come on, let's drink.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.060
Bartender, fill me up, hurry.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.520
Do you have a problem
with me drinking your whisky?

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.090
My boss is talking to you.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.480
Got a problem with that?

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.760
I'm asking you—
do you have a problem with that?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720
Thanks for today.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.540
It's nothing. The owner is my friend.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.700
Director Du, you're quite good at
fighting.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.030
How come you couldn't handle a few drunks?

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.510
I had too much to drink today.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.590
Had too much to drink?

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.590
I don't think so.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.200
The bartender told me everything.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.270
After throwing one punch,

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.870
you didn't fight back at all.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.960
What's wrong?

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.770
Something on your mind?

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.400
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.640
I just had too much to drink.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.500
Work has been exhausting lately.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.350
Work?

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.050
I don't think that's it.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.920
Du Linfeng,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.680
do you know

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.800
why I became a forensic doctor?

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.440
Isn't it because you like the job?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.570
That's ridiculous.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.720
How many people actually enjoy
working with corpses?

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.300
The reason I like being a forensic doctor
is that...

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.480
the dead never lie.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.510
No matter if the body

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.040
has been dismembered

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.590
or is rotting with a terrible stench,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.280
it always gives me
the most honest answers.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.560
But the living don't necessarily
tell the truth.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.330
Dr. Ding, why are you telling me all this?

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.240
Because...

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.690
deep down, I believe you don't lie either.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.440
I'm the director
of the Intelligence Department.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.160
Director?

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.310
In Lu's eyes,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.170
you're just a foot soldier.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
Actually, I know.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.830
Although you seem carefree every day,

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.090
living it up in luxury,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.440
deep down,
you feel very insecure, don't you?

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.560
From beginning to end...

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.240
the only one who's ever truly reached
your heart

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.400
is Lu Yizhen.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.880
Am I right?

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.520
It seems you're not only good at
reading the dead.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.270
Anyway,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.250
you still have my blessing.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.160
After all,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.590
being in love with someone

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.390
is still quite a happy thing,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.270
isn't it?

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.710
You're not that good at reading people.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.900
I'm giving up on Lu Yizhen.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:26.960
What?

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.680
I used to think

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.480
that the only result that mattered
was getting what you want.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.510
But now I've realized

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.040
that the journey can also be
the destination.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.200
Loving someone

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.070
is about wanting them
to be happy, isn't it?

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.200
If my love becomes a burden to her,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.220
then what meaning does it even have?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.680
Thank you for tonight, Dr. Ding.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.540
Sorry for taking up your whole evening.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.170
But...

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.790
I'm fine.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.290
I'm Du Linfeng, after all.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.610
You just got injured.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.270
You shouldn't drink any more.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.570
Alright, alright.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.510
Lu Yizhen, you're really...

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.480
Okay, okay, I know I was wrong.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.240
I was wrong, Dr. Si.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.790
I'm sorry.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.120
I'll take better care of myself next time.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.190
Fine, I won't lecture you.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.310
You've been up all night.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.310
Get some rest now.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.290
I only took a short leave.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.400
I need to get back to the hospital soon.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.070
Well,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.270
I'll take a sedative and go to sleep.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.530
Otherwise, I keep having nightmares.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.970
You're going through
those pills that quickly?

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.620
Is this the sedative
Dr. Gu prescribed for you?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680
That's not right.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.240
This doesn't look like a regular sedative.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.000
I went through

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.160
all the files
from the kidnapping case back then

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.110
and found a man named Tang Jiahao.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.640
According to the records,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.750
this person only played a minor role

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.750
in the kidnapping case,

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.350
responsible for some cleanup work.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.750
So the person
who hunted down Huang Kaiyuan

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.720
could be him.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
If it's him,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.400
why would he kill Huang Kaiyuan?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.060
Weren't they on the same side?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.240
I don't know.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.750
But one thing's clear:

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.790
Huang Kaiyuan went to the Zhuo Residence
after he escaped.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.110
After he left,

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.550
the entire Zhuo family was massacred.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.550
Huang Kaiyuan was also hunted down.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.220
If that's the case,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.550
what grudge is there

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.500
between Zhuo Chaoxiong and Tang Jiahao?

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.630
Too many things have happened lately.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.480
First, during the prison riot,

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.540
we found Ghost, who was already dead,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.110
along with those three people
from Zhuo Chaoxiong's group.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.030
Then, immediately after,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.110
Wu Xiaoxiao was killed

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.480
in our place by the Zhuo family.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.880
Before we even figured out a reason
to investigate the Zhuo family,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.270
they were brutally massacred.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.930
Now Huang Kaiyuan is dead too.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
There are too many events and clues.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.110
They seem connected,

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.590
but we can't find the link.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.880
We must have missed

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.410
some crucial information.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.350
And Yang Xiaolin hasn't been seen

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.310
since then.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.550
Well...

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.210
How am I supposed to report this
to Director Huo?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.840
I'll go talk to Director Huo.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.200
There's too much involved in this case.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.930
It can't be sorted out quickly.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.640
I've put your clothes in the closet.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.960
And your medicine. It's in the drawer.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.490
Remember to take it on time.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.140
Take your medicine! Take your medicine!

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.400
Now there are only the two of us left,

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.800
depending on each other.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.830
Why are you taking care of me?

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.520
What business did your father run?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.920
Why do you want to know these things?

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.960
We're in the same boat now.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.790
What exactly do you want to know?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.660
Do you think I'm just someone
who's after money?

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.240
I want more than you think.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.900
I thought I could become the boss's wife.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.920
Who would have thought I'd end up with

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.580
a good-for-nothing like you?

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.480
I've bet everything on you.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.830
You have no way out.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.790
And neither do I.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.460
I can only make you the boss again.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.240
You need to tell me everything.
