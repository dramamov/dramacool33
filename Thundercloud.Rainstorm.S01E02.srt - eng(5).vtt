Don't look at me like that.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.440
That's how I am. I fall in love easily.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.240
So, I fall out of love easily too.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.680
That's usually how it goes.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.090
So just pretend you didn't hear it.

What can I do to make you
fall out of love faster?

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.340
I was drunk and crossed the line.

I owe it to you to help you.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.410
Do you hate it that much?

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.660
Do you hate it...

that I like you?

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.710
It's not about whether I hate it or not...

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.570
Yeah,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.030
I hate it.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.690
Tell me.

I'll help you.

Didn't you ask for it?

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.350
No, I didn't think you'd really kiss me.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.730
Also,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.110
I haven't brushed my teeth...

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.560
Then hurry up and brush your teeth.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.870
What's with him?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.930

Thank you.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.720
But

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.940
you just needed to brush your teeth.
Why'd you take a shower?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.640
Huh?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.360
Um... Just.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.390
No way in hell.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.620
I didn't say anything.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.920
Go to sleep.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.240
I'm off to work!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.880
Lee Iljo!

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.680
What's going on?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.370
When did he go out?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.130
Tell me which one you like!

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.100
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.470
So which one do you prefer?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.290
It's so hard to choose.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.110
They're both attractive in different ways.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.550
Then I'll choose Iljo.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.760
Nice. No overlap.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.210
Really?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.860
When did you change your target?

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.550
If Suhyo is like a rough Dobermann,

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.760
Iljo is like a white Maltese.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.140
You just want to tame him.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.470
But they seem quite close.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.120
I know.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.650
They don't seem like
just a boss and a part-timer.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.670
Didn't Iljo just recently
start working in the cafe?

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.560
Did they know each other before?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.940
Right. They came to work
together this morning too.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.650
Yeah.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.370
Feast for the eyes
first thing in the morning.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.510
Total eye candies, huh?

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.630
Let's go to the cafe again soon.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.640
Aren't you getting in?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.750
You guys go ahead.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.480
I want to go to the beach.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.730
Then let's go to the beach.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.160
I have to work.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.640
What work? I'll give you time off.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.910
I'm serious!

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.830
Jeonghan!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.900
Three tomato juices.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.720
Two iced vanilla lattes.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.850
Cafe mochas,

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.500
one hot and one iced.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.590
Right. Peppermint tea too,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.540
with two or three ice cubes.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.440
Okay.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.770
Do you need money?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.620
Tell me if you need more money.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.730
How much can you earn at such a cafe?

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.980
Here's your card.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.940
You can have it.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.890
Don't mooch off random people.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.760
You can deliver the drinks
to the office personally,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.230
right?

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.220
Yes, I'll do that.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.780
Thank you,

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.600
[Jang Suhyo]

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.520
Mr. Jang Suhyo.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.540
Here are the documents you asked for.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.560
Okay, thanks.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.760
No text or call, huh?

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.090
[Seo Jeonghan]

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:11.900
Come to the restaurant Royal Cuisine
after work.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.900
Come to the restaurant Royal Cuisine]
[Seo Jeonghan:

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.740
after work.]

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.210
Are you Mr. Lee Iljo?

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:33.440
Yes.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.110
This way, please.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.240
Sit.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:14.720
Why are there... only the two of us here?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.650
I booked the whole place.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.020
To have dinner

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.680
with you alone.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.770
You told me not to like you.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.070
Did I suggest anything?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.890
It's just a dinner.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.120
Is anything the matter?

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.700
Eat.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.300
[Jang Suhyo]

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.870
Answer it.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.770
Answer it here.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.840
-Hello—
-Lee Iljo, where are you?

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.810
Where are you and what are you doing?

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.680
I'm having dinner with Jeonghan.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.280
Are you crazy?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.420
Didn't you say it's over with him?

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.870
Did he force you to go there?

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.150
So he can toy with you as he wishes again?

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.360
Suhyo, it's not like that...

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.420
I'll go pick you up now.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.950
Where are you?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.560
Hey, Lee Iljo!

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.410
I'll call you again later.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.490
Hello?

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.810
Iljo—

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.010
Iljo.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.160
Yeah?

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.120
I'm sleepy.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.020
What? Oh...

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.420
Let's go home then.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.310
I'm too sleepy to go.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.770
Then...

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.860
W-Why did we come here?

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.470
It's hot.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.780
Hey, you... you'll catch a cold.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.450
It's so stuffy.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.190
Untie me.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.520
Hey, you...

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.750
What are you doing?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.670
Ah!

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.860
It hurts.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.760
Lee Iljo.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.770
I told you...

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.090
All of your rights

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.010
belong to me.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.320
Am I wrong?

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.710
Jeonghan.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.060
Do whatever you want to me.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.490
Jeonghan...

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.060
[In the next episode]

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.190
Why are you hiding in the blanket?

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.930
Don't look!

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.360
Did I make those marks?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.070
You just want people to know I'm yours.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.780
I didn't know that

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.670
this is what you meant

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.430
by paying with my body.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.650
No, I don't want to leave.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.250
Did you sleep with him?

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.740
Take him away now.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.420
This isn't Lee Iljo's house anyway.
