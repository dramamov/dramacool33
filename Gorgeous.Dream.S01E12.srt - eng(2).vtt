00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

00:00:55.212 --> 00:00:58.362
(Liu Residence)

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:04.012
Mengyan,

00:01:04.413 --> 00:01:06.973
I leave you in charge
of the household affairs for now.

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:09.012
If you have any questions,

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:11.333
ask Steward Chen.

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:19.852
I'm at your service, Young Madam Liu.

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:40.587
(Blossom Theater, 17,000 taels)

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:43.212
Steward Chen,

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.893
this is a lot of money
to spend on a troupe.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:48.732
Young Madam Liu.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:52.452
Master enjoys Miss Yue Jiao's
performances from Blossom Theater.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:57.932
Miss Yue Jiao?

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.053
Miss Yue Jiao is Ning City's
most famous performer.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.890
She never performs at private banquets,
only on the Blossom Theater stage.

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:05.053
Her fee

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:06.533
isn't cheap.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:11.173
(Ten years ago, Liu Residence)

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.853
Take the young master to his room,

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:14.170
and keep a close eye on him!

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.990
Don't let him run off
to see Yue Jiao again.

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:26.053
(Yue Jiao)

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:28.773
(must be the key to uncovering)

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:30.092
(Liu Qinghe's secrets.)

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.173
(Blossom Theater, 17,000 taels)

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.293
(Blossom Theater)
Great!

00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:36.692
Great!

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:38.453
Wonderful!

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:39.132
Great!

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.573
What a great performance.

00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:41.773
Indeed.

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:47.493
Departing from one's hometown

00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:53.573
to pursue education in Hang City.

00:02:54.453 --> 00:03:00.493
See an old pavilion ahead.

00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:01.173
Great!

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:03.613
Great!

00:03:03.972 --> 00:03:04.453
Miss Lan,

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.773
my master invites you upstairs.

00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:27.573
Please.

00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:31.613
Great!

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:39.812
Not bad.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.710
You managed to find your way here.

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.252
I've already accepted your tea.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.013
I'll serve you the best I can, My Lord.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.372
Do enlighten me.

00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:00.613
What's so special

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:02.453
about this theater?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.532
All the money the Liu family offers
their mysterious backer

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:09.333
flows through this place.

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:10.853
Onstage,

00:04:11.493 --> 00:04:12.972
the Blossom Theater sings of romance.

00:04:13.532 --> 00:04:14.110
Beneath that,

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.692
it's the heart
of the Liu family's money network.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:25.772
It seems we need the right opening,

00:04:25.853 --> 00:04:27.812
something that lets us

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:30.173
topple Liu Qinghe in one move,

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:32.252
and use this money trail to drag out

00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.613
the big fish hiding behind him.

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:34.613
Correct.

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:37.772
So the secret inside this theater

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:39.892
is our way in.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:42.613
Miss Yue Jiao!

00:04:42.692 --> 00:04:44.012
It's Miss Yue Jiao!

00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:46.892
Blossom Theater's most famous performer,

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.413
Miss Yue Jiao, is about to appear.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.493
Aren't you going to watch?

00:04:50.892 --> 00:04:51.533
Great!

00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:52.493
Great!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:53.733
Great!

00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:56.293
Amazing. Wonderful indeed.

00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:06.733
Great!

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:07.853
Great!

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.372
Great!

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.932
As expected of Miss Yue Jiao.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:14.812
Indeed.

00:05:15.572 --> 00:05:16.452
Excellent performance.

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:21.053
That's part of my dowry.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:24.132
Looks like you've found your opening.

00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:08.973
(Where did she go?)

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:37.372
Have the ledgers been put back?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.413
Rest assured, Master.

00:06:38.613 --> 00:06:39.733
I handled it myself.

00:06:41.293 --> 00:06:42.572
And those chests of jewels.

00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:45.413
Tell the servants to be careful.

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:48.012
Deliver them to the intended recipient.

00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:48.692
Yes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.290
Prepare the carriage for return.

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:53.053
(Liu Qinghe,)

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:55.372
(who's backing you?)

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.173
(There must be a hidden chamber here.)

00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:09.653
(And the ledgers.)

00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:11.733
(Maybe)

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.332
(they can help me
bring Liu Qinghe down.)

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.413
(If he notices I'm not
at the residence,)

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:20.190
(I'm finished.)

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:22.012
(I need to get back at once.)

00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:28.413
Mengyan.

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:34.372
Father.

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:35.853
What are you doing here?

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:44.572
Why are you here?

00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:47.572
Father, good timing.

00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:51.372
I heard from Steward Chen

00:07:51.493 --> 00:07:53.252
that you're quite close
with Miss Yue Jiao.

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.733
I'd like to meet her,

00:07:56.093 --> 00:07:58.053
and I hoped you'd introduce me.

00:07:58.493 --> 00:08:00.932
And why are you looking for her?

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:05.293
I want to help you.

00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:08.012
So much has happened
in the residence lately,

00:08:08.812 --> 00:08:10.653
and the rumors outside
are getting worse.

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:12.853
I took the liberty of writing a play

00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:14.932
praising the honor of the Liu family.

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:19.692
If Miss Yue Jiao performs it,

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:21.252
more people will know

00:08:21.452 --> 00:08:23.892
our family's virtue and integrity.

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:30.452
It's all

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:31.853
I could think of

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.652
to ease your troubles.

00:08:37.613 --> 00:08:38.892
You're thoughtful.

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:40.853
Very well, you may proceed.

00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:42.613
However…

00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:46.372
Miss Yue Jiao hasn't been well.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.652
She can't perform right now.

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:49.412
It's just as well.

00:08:49.693 --> 00:08:51.772
I recently met a young man

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.973
who says he knows you well.

00:08:55.532 --> 00:08:57.093
He can help you.

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:58.172
Mr. Tang,

00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:00.892
come greet Miss Mengyan.

00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:05.573
Master.

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:07.573
this was found in a hidden compartment

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:08.652
in Xie Ruilan's room.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.933
It's Young Madam Liu's dossier.

00:09:18.372 --> 00:09:19.573
That madwoman

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:20.813
has been digging

00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:22.437
(Lan Mengyan was once involved)
into Mengyan's past before she married

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.853
(with a performer named Tang Run)
into the Liu family.

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:25.933
Lan Mengyan was involved

00:09:26.453 --> 00:09:28.573
with a performer in her youth.

00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:30.532
The man's name

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:32.093
is Tang Run.

00:09:34.453 --> 00:09:35.052
Follow

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:36.532
the trail.

00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:38.933
Bring him

00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:40.372
to me.

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:41.333
Yes.

00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:56.224
(Half a year ago, Lan Mengyan,)
You'd really take my place

00:09:56.248 --> 00:09:57.252
(adopted daughter of the Liu family)
and marry Liu Wenyu for me?

00:09:58.252 --> 00:09:59.853
He's an addict.

00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:01.052
Unruly, reckless.

00:10:01.973 --> 00:10:04.252
Your life there won't be pleasant.

00:10:04.892 --> 00:10:06.252
If not for the marriage contract,

00:10:06.453 --> 00:10:06.772
I…

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.412
It's all right.

00:10:07.772 --> 00:10:08.652
Don't worry.

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:10.333
I have my own plans.

00:10:11.453 --> 00:10:12.892
Leave with the man you love.

00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:14.333
As far as you can.

00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:19.093
Thank you, Miss Shen.

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:22.372
Run.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.733
(Tang Run, performer)

00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:28.933
Thank you, Miss Shen.

00:10:30.493 --> 00:10:31.172
All went well.

00:10:42.453 --> 00:10:43.652
(Lan Mengyan's lover?)

00:10:44.892 --> 00:10:46.012
(What's he doing here?)

00:10:47.132 --> 00:10:48.333
(After all my planning,)

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.670
(will everything fall apart
because of him?)

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:53.052
Miss Lan.

00:10:54.093 --> 00:10:54.733
It is you.

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:56.772
We haven't seen each other

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.930
ever since you married
into the Liu family.

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:04.012
Mr. Tang,

00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:05.172
it's been a long time.

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.252
I didn't expect you
to come to Ning City.

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:08.853
Looks like

00:11:09.012 --> 00:11:10.470
I can enjoy your performances again.

00:11:12.493 --> 00:11:13.213
Mengyan,

00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:16.172
you claim you don't understand the arts.

00:11:16.813 --> 00:11:18.372
Yet, you're clearly a fan of theater.

00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:23.733
Mr. Tang's performances
are extraordinary.

00:11:24.493 --> 00:11:27.333
Back then, even I couldn't resist
pretending to be cultured for once.

00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:30.093
Miss Lan, you flatter me.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.487
(Two hours later)

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:50.973
You're bold.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.690
Before I could look for you,

00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:53.813
you came to me.

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:56.093
Aren't you afraid I'll expose you?

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:57.733
Shen Wanqing…

00:11:58.493 --> 00:11:58.973
No.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:01.532
I should call you

00:12:03.252 --> 00:12:04.333
Lan Mengyan now.

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:08.573
Go on.

00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:10.772
What do you want

00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:12.292
for your silence?

00:12:13.252 --> 00:12:14.292
300 taels of gold.

00:12:14.973 --> 00:12:16.573
Otherwise, by tomorrow,

00:12:17.132 --> 00:12:20.132
the whole city will know Young Madam Liu
