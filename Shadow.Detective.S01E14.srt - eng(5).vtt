00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.160
Keep this safe.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.250
I will tolerate no errors.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.520
Everything can be arranged,
as long as the money's right.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.470
Hold on to this receipt.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.000
When you come to collect your item,
this slip is all we'll honor.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.560
Yizhen,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.640
their clothing style suits you so well.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920
This piece looks lovely on you.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.860
Well, I'll pick another one, then.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.540
This one's beautiful too.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.990
And this one?

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.300
Go on, just try it!

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.650
Come on, let's go—

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.670
give it a shot.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.150
Here, have some water.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.750
Thank you.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.620
Now that's more like the Miss Lu we know!

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.250
Here, take a look in the mirror.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.360
Honestly, this is more exhausting
than investigating cases.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.950
Si Min.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.840
You look beautiful.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.660
What's so tiring about it?

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.030
All you do

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.190
is work;

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.550
you should put some effort
into your appearance once in a while.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.610
Remember how polished you used to be?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.240
Speaking of the alumni gathering,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.360
whose house did you say it was at again?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.420
Zhuo Chaoxiong's.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.570
Don't tell me

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.150
you only agreed to go
because of work?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.800
No,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.310
didn't I tell you before?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.840
Let's go with this one, then.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.040
You'd better mean it.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.880
Please wrap this dress for me.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.540
Are there any others you like?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.079
Wrap this one up as well.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.839
So these are all part of a set, right?

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.640
Yes, they are.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.290
Trying to butter me up won't work.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.600
If I find out

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.070
you're only going for a case,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.000
I will drag you out of there myself.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.930
Understood.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.870
Thank you.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.760
And please include my clothes
inside there.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.360
Of course.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.720
Yizhen,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.750
how do I look?

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.670
You're the most stunning person
here tonight.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.110
Look over there—

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.120
that's Attorney Chen.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.390
I heard he earns a high salary

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.520
and comes from a well-off family.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.890
And that one—

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.070
that's Dr. Gu, our senior
from university.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.060
He was one of the best
in our college back then.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.310
Hello, everyone,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.160
thank you for gracing my humble home.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.270
You honor me

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.920
-with your presence.
-Is that Zhuo Chaoxiong?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.070
-Yeah, that's him.
-Please, enjoy the food, drinks,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.400
and festivities to your heart's content.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.630
And the one next to him—his son?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.240
Yes,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.570
that's Zhuo Feng,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.650
the only son in the family.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.240
Don't tell me you're interested in him?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.270
Just asking.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.040
Phew,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.110
glad you're not.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.909
Rumor has it he's quite the playboy—

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.060
you really don't want to get involved.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.870
Plus, I've heard
he's heavily into medication.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.510
Si Min,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.830
our old classmates are all over there.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.890
Let's go say hello—

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.870
come on!

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.560
Alright, I'll head over then.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.090
Go ahead.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.040
Are you alright?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.950
It's fine, it's fine.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.680
My apologies.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.120
I...

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.380
Y-You're here too?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.390
I meant to reach out,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.920
but haven't had the chance.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.980
Do you have any idea

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.330
how much trouble
that last report of yours caused me?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.070
How could that be?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.800
It was just a standard article.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.360
Well, if it isn't Xiaoxiao.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.840
Surprised to see you here.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.300
Xiaoxiao has been in the press
for years now, hasn't she?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.980
Guess we should call her

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.210
Editor Wu these days.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.080
Which paper was it again?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.830
Wasn't she fired
from The Republican Daily News?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.000
She's probably working
for some tabloid now—

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.200
the kind that chases celebrity gossip.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.470
What's it called...?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.480
And she still dares show up
at an alumni gathering like this?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.830
Trying to be

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.070
a social climber, is she?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.630
Enough.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.720
With so many people here today,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.830
your loud, snide remarks

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.160
are just embarrassing.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.600
Let's go.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.000
Thank you.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.830
I've been treated like that before too—

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.480
I know how it feels.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.220
But you don't need to thank me.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.560
I'd have done the same

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560
for anyone today.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.860
It wasn't about you.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.750
Still, thank you.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.380
Why are you here?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.750
For the same reason

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.830
you are.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.470
I came to dance.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.590
So did I.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.700
Where's Guan Cen?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.679
How much do you already know?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.260
I don't know what you're investigating,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.900
but it must be connected

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.450
to what happened back then.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.840
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left me out.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.480
I know

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.790
you both are just trying to protect me—

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.660
to keep me from getting hurt again.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.970
But I was the one
who went through it all,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.960
the one who suffered.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.690
How could you cut me out of this?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.200
Ghost died in prison.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.570
The case is complicated—

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.300
we can't track down the killer.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360
The only lead we have

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.150
points to Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.510
We found out

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.870
there's a secret meeting
happening here tonight,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.330
so we came to investigate.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.360
Have you found them yet?

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.600
The Zhuo Compound is enormous.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.670
We're completely in the dark
on where to even begin.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.130
I also lost track
of Zhuo Chaoxiong just now.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.060
Here's our chance.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.880
I'm heading up.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.480
Wait for me.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.300
Okay.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.800
Let's go. Follow them.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.350
I have one condition:

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.930
if there's any danger,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.160
you run immediately.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.310
I understand.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.540
Where did he go?

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.110
How could he just vanish into thin air?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.540
This hallway doesn't lead anywhere else...

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.070
There's something off
about this cabinet.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.130
So this is what it's come to—
the Chamber calls a meeting,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.600
and we can't even get everyone
in the same room.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.750
It seems the Chamber means little

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.720
to some of you now.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.840
With your two top lieutenants missing,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.460
how can this meeting proceed?

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.950
The Captain is away on business.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.080
As for the Butcher...

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.310
he's off meeting a client

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.570
about some major deal.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.290
He sent me in his place,

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.910
and Butcher said

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.690
he's confident the Chamber
will understand.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.600
If you're so capable, then by all means—
handle your own affairs.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.440
The Chamber

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.320
certainly won't stop you.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.170
But since the last fire,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.520
we've faced relentless pressure
these years.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.050
We finally tracked down Ghost,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.960
only to end in a stalemate.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.320
Mr. Zhuo,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.120
the incident in the prison—

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.150
you owe us

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.260
an explanation.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.280
Please assure the leadership—

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.410
I will provide a full explanation.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720
Some matters,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.240
the Chamber may overlook.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.630
But others—

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.120
the Chamber

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.360
will never tolerate them.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.210
Who's there?

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.970
Let's go.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.630
Mr. Zhuo,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.330
Linfeng, why are you so out of breath?

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.170
We were just dancing—

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.060
got a bit carried away having fun.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.360
Aren't you going to introduce me

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.640
to such a lovely dance partner?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.720
This is Lu Yizhen, my girlfriend.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.080
Your girlfriend?

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.550
Your father never mentioned her to me.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.280
Miss Lu, are you also an alumna
of the Chongde University?

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.910
Yes.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.080
What a delightful coincidence.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.950
Pleasure to meet you.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.720
Enjoy.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.440
May I ask

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.080
where you work, Miss Lu?

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.100
Lu Yizhen.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.550
Lu Yizhen is the first woman
from our university

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.000
to join the police station.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.660
Quite impressive, isn't she?

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.890
So we have a real heroine in our midst.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.550
The police station

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.320
and the intelligence department—

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.070
what a perfect match.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.910
Linfeng,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.790
it's been too long.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.090
Why don't we seize the moment?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.660
Come on.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.030
Let's have a proper chat.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.570
Mr. Zhuo.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.880
We've found it.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.400
Linfeng,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.080
it seems something urgent
requires my attention.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.680
We'll catch up another time.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.990
Of course, Mr. Zhuo.
I won't hold you up.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.370
Are you alright?

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.350
I need to use the restroom.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.030
Lu Yizhen?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.120
What are you doing here?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.170
And why are you so drunk?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.790
I'm not drunk.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.380
Why are you inside?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.000
Weren't you supposed
to be keeping watch outside?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.060
And why is she here?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.840
She knows.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.330
Don't you understand
how dangerous this is?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.690
Even if she found out,
you shouldn't have brought her along!

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.630
D-Don't lecture him.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.780
I came on my own.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.920
And don't think

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.520
I don't know what you two

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.910
are up to.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.360
If you won't include me,
I'll investigate by myself!

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.150
Let go of me!

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.080
How are you going
to investigate anything being so drunk?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.480
I'll take her back.
You handle things here.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.410
-Feeling sick?
-Pull over.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.550
If you can't hold your liquor,
you shouldn't have pushed yourself.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.520
You don't need to go this far for a case.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.000
Stop lecturing me.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.410
Why are you always lecturing people?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.090
I'm not lecturing you.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.170
Not lecturing?

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.000
Then what was that just now?

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.050
I'm asking you—

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.090
what do you call that?

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.980

Here's something for the hangover.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.140
[Jasmine Cafe]

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.290
Should I say women are too kind-hearted,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.810
or that they're too forgetful?

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.480
You know,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.240
when I was studying in France,

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.410
my route from home to school

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.610
passed through a street full of bars.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.730
Drunk foreigners
often harassed female students,

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.830
so after class,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.220
I always hurried back.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.330
That does sound dangerous.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.860
Exactly.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.240
Once, I stayed late at the library,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.350
and on my way back,

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.820
I ran into that group
of drunk foreigners again.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.950
Just as they were about to surround me,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.840
my senior showed up—

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.650
he stepped in and shielded me.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.690
So, were you close with this senior?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.580
We'd only met a few times,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.420
just casual acquaintances.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.480
Later,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.810
he told me
that we actually lived close by.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.030
After that, he'd wait for me
after class every day

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.000
and walk me home.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.100
We'd talk the whole way—

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.160
from medicine to philosophy,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.440
life to art—

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.270
as if we'd never run out of things to say.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.510
And then?

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.240
Well…

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.980
eventually, I realized

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.580
our places weren't actually
on the way at all.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.440
Every time after dropping me off,

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.760
he had to take a long detour to get back.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.960
I never would've thought

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.620
you had such a romantic story.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.980
Aren't you curious

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.850
what happened between us after that?

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.510
You ended up together, didn't you?

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.060
But you also thought
he was a good guy, didn't you?

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.060
He was wonderful,

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.370
and he treated me well.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.690
So... when he confessed his feelings,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.770
I turned him down without hesitation.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.680
Why?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.200
Because love isn't

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.710
just about giving and receiving in return.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.730
There's no formula to measure it.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.540
It is just

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.610
a spark—

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.070
fleeting, like lightning.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.730
I didn't feel that for him,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.790
so it wouldn't have been right
for either of us.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.440
What a shame, though.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.290
It wasn't a shame at all.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.870
He's since met someone
who truly loves him,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.920
and they're very happy together.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.040
If I had been with him back then

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.620
just out of gratitude,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.030
well,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.310
it would've been unfair to us both.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.690
Lu Yizhen,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.410
get in here.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.190
What was that stuff you made me drink?

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.420
Did you throw up?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.070
How did you know?

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.690
One sip, and I was heaving for ages.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.490
Good. Got it all out, didn't you?

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.240
You're a lot clearer-headed now
than yesterday.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.120
You're late.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.960
I was...

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.790
h-hungover.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.250
Inspector.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.240
Inspector!

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.150
Why is your face flushed?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.410
No, it's not.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.840
Let's focus. What is it?

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.670
We have a new case.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.720
The victim...

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.390
is someone you all know.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.890
The victim's name was Wu Xiaoxiao.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.780
Wasn't she the one
who gave you a hard time last time?

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.660
Do you want to head back first?

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.060
I can handle things here.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.560
She might have died in my place.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.200
That shawl…

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.870
I was the one who brought it
to Zhuo Chaoxiong's compound yesterday.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.270
How did it end up on her?

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.640
She was there too.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.060
Du Linfeng and I found

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.240
where they were holding
their secret meeting,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.970
but someone inside spotted us.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.750
While we were running,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.470
I saw her hiding in a corner.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.790
But the situation was too urgent—

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.390
we didn't have time
to wonder why she was there.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.750
This was my fault.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.570
We'll prioritize Wu Xiaoxiao's case.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.600
For the next few days, be careful—

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.770
don't go out alone.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.040
This happened
at Zhuo Chaoxiong's compound.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.830
He's involved, without a doubt.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.560
How did things end up like this…

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.110
If Wu Xiaoxiao was truly killed
as our scapegoat,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.640
then Zhuo Chaoxiong is
definitely involved.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.440
What were you all just discussing?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.200
Watch out!

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.150
What's going on?

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.540
-How could you be so clumsy?
-Are you okay?

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.340
It's alright.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.470
Could you please take me to clean up?

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.070
Of course,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.320
my apologies.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.940
Right this way.
I'll take you to clean that off.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.520
This side, please. Yes, here.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.240
Lu Yizhen,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.640
I don't want to hurt you.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.850
Listen carefully.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.070
Tomorrow at dawn,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.400
meet me at the restaurant
across the street.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.270
I have the information
you're looking for.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.730
But you can't tell anyone—

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.590
you must come alone.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.350
Okay.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.160
You can drop me off here,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.550
thanks.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.240
Hello?

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.270
There's a street vendor
at the corner selling candied hawthorns.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.600
Buy two sticks,
then come right back here.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.920
Alright.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.660
Could you take me
in that direction, please?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.510
Thank you.
