Let Mom help you change
your clothes, okay?

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.870
We'll go to sleep after changing.

Come on, Mom helps you change.

Go away! Don't touch me!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.280
Lu,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.630
I'm talking to you.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.980
I'm listening.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.710
Well,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.630
what kind of place is
the International Settlement?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.520
It's a place where you're constantly...

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.150
Mr. Wang, be careful with fire!

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
Dealing with murderers.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.590
You think the patrol room there
is that easy to join?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.310
Besides, you're a girl.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.200
They definitely won't want you.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.590
If you ask me,

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.570
you'd better just stay here.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960
Maybe someday you'll meet
a rich young master

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.620
and then get married in style,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.020
wouldn't that be nice?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
That's not for me.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.990
I'm hoping to become an inspector someday.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.079
Inspector?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.150
Inspector Lu?

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.680
You seem like a practical person—

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.810
how can you indulge in such fantasies?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.590
Let's put everything else aside.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.420
Even if you get into a patrol room,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.480
you'll have to start from the bottom.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.630
Serving tea, pouring water,
buying breakfast—

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.890
that's just the start.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.430
Then the inspector will throw
a pile of files

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.360
at you to review,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.360
and you can't leave
until you've finished reading them.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.470
And here's the thing—
reading them is pointless.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.930
Would you still want that?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.950
If you ask me,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.190
it's better to just stay here.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.600
There you are.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.170
An elderly person has gone missing

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.240
from the Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520
Perfect, you should go check it out.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.190
Get lost!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.800
It's mealtime.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.460
You're hungry, but we're not?

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.240
I despise people like you the most!

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.370
-Alright. Let's go.
-Go! I'll treat you to dinner later!

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.710
Yizhen,

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:43.760
you go first.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760
My stomach hurts.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.200
Maybe I've got the runs.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.910
Really? What timing—

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.970
getting diarrhea right at mealtime?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.750
I'll come look for you later.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.630
It really is diarrhea,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.240
I swear.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.120
Who reported the case?

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.010
I did.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.720
One of our elderly residents is missing.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.980
We've searched the entire nursing home.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.480
What's the elderly person's name?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.880
When did they go missing?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.480
The elderly lady is named Gao Wenxiu.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.580
She's quite advanced in age.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.930
She usually walks with a wooden cane.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.390
She didn't show up for lunch,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.659
and then we realized she was missing.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.480
Mrs. Gao gets confused sometimes.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.080
She likes to talk to herself.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.159
Apart from staying in the facility,

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.630
does she go anywhere else?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.630
We usually take the residents

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.230
to the nearby park for walks.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.840
But we don't let them go out
by themselves.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.100
Officer, I need to go.
I have something to attend to.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.510
Hello.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.970
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.000
Excuse me, have you seen

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.750
an elderly woman

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.680
with a walking stick and gray hair?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.560
No.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.800
Are all these paths connected?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.170
Yes, this path leads to the intersection.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.920
If you continue on this path,
there will be more people.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.520
You can ask around there.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.560
Okay, thank you.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.620
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.120

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.650
from Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.750
For heaven's sake,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.920
how many times have I told you

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.170
not to meddle in other people's business?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.950
Do you have any idea

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.950
how much trouble
you've gotten yourself into?

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.280
How is this meddling...

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.370
Where did you get that police uniform?

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.390
It's mine, of course.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.720
I'm a trainee police officer in this area.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.800
What are you doing here?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.190
This is their jurisdiction.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.950
It's none of our business.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.350
This park is open to the public,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.630
but it belongs to the British.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.150
Director Huo happens to know them.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.650
So if anything happens in this area,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.560
we handle it.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600

handling a case.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.120
saying they found the elderly lady.

Let's go quickly and find out
what happened.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.000
The elderly lady...

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.960
Go check on her quickly.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.180
After all,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.440
that case is

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.070
what you should be handling.

the suspect from back then

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.060
would become a police officer.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.430

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.310

Brief me on the victim.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.460
The deceased was Liu Jialiang,
45 years old,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.800
the director
of the nearby Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.060
Did he have any family?

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.800
Yes.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.920
His mother, 80 years old now.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.050
This is his address.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.510
Take someone with you
to check on his mother.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.360
Okay.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.430
Luo, let's go.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.040
The victim has no fatal wounds
on his body.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.800
The cause of death is... asphyxiation.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.980
Asphyxiation?

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.510
Based on the body's condition,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.150
the time of death was likely
3 to 5 days ago.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.780
The killer hung him upside down
from the tree

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.030
and laid out food beneath him.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.669
He likely wanted the victim
to see the food,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.510
suffer,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.710
and eventually starve to death.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.240
So, based on your conclusion...

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.720
the killer drew a cross on his forehead...

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.510
suggesting this was a punitive killing?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.040
Unfortunately,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.090
the killer doesn't have
much medical knowledge.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.120
Without water, a person

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.470
will die within 3 days.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.320
But if hung upside down,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.630
the situation is completely different.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.750
The liver and intestines

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.310
press against the lungs,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.350
causing oxygen deprivation

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.790
and resulting in death by asphyxiation.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.590
So, how long can someone survive

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.800
if hung upside down?

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.200
When I was studying abroad,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320
my professor told me about

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.510
a similar case.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.960
An American was hung upside down
in a cave.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.670
He only survived for about 28 hours.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.210
But in any case, it's less than 3 days.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.290
Her family members died one after another
on the battlefield.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.630
That's why she stays in the nursing home.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.000
Now, her memory has severely deteriorated,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.650
and she gets confused frequently.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.670
My home is very close
to this nursing home.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.240
Just now,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.380
she came to my house
looking for my mother again.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.670
So I brought her back here.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.600
Meijuan.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.440
Meijuan, you came.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.550
You got the letter?

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.670
Letter?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.880
What letter?

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.170
Mrs. Gao is confused.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.740
She asks about it several times every day.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.120
Okay.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.550
Now that she's returned safely,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.920
there's nothing to worry about.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.850
That settles it.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.950
See? Mrs. Gao is fine.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.410
Please take good care of her from now on.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080
Where is your director?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.210
I haven't seen him since the incident.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.430
The director is quite busy.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.740
Our nursing home is funded by the church.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.940
Every month, he has to discuss with
the bishop

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.750
how donations and supplies are used.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.410
so the director is often away
from the facility.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.400
Let's go now.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.560
I really have diarrhea this time.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Thank you for your help.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.150
Goodbye.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.420
Take care.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.550
Yizhen!

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.670
There's a big sale at Sincere today.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.440
I bought a lot of good stuff.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.490
See if there's anything you need.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.080
What are you smiling about?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.940
Are you in love?

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.960
What's that?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.760
I'm reporting for duty tomorrow!

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.480
Really?

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.390
That's great!

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.720
Your dream of becoming an inspector
is within reach!

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.650
Inspector? That's so far away.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.510
I'm just starting as
a third-class police officer.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.480
What's wrong with being
a third-class police officer?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.100
That's pretty good, isn't it?

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.100
At least you're on the right track now.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.900
You've sacrificed so much
to join the patrol room.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.120
Now you've finally got what you wanted.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.250
I'm so happy for you.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.320
Do you know who I ran into
during my interview

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.580
at the police academy?

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.480
Who?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.770
Guan Cen.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.380
Guan Cen?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.120
[Laozha Patrol Room]

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.750
Excuse me,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.030
could you please

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.300
slow down and repeat your orders?

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.200
Salty soy milk.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.550
-Soup dumplings!
-Crispy chicken feet and tofu pudding!

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.950
Wontons! I want wontons.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.320
Inspector Guan.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.480
What brings you here?

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.610
Inspector Zhu,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.080
I told Director Huo the other day
that I'm short-handed.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.910
He has agreed

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.350
to let me borrow someone from your team.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.920
As you can see,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.310
we're also stretched thin here.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.550
Inspector Zhu,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.240
just for a few days,
then I'll return them to you.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.380
Well, since you've made the request,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.350
I'll find someone for you.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.340
Inspector Zhu.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.300
She will do.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.870
She's participated in the case
we're investigating,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.670
so she's quite familiar with it.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.940
Inspector Zhu,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.690
I haven't finished the task
you assigned me.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.330
I can't go.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.280
Inspector Guan.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.120
You're here to poach my officer?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.180
Inspector Zhu,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.940
please, don't say that.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.000
I just want to solve the case quickly.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.240
If Director Huo blames us,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.240
neither of us will have an easy time.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.390
-I won't let you use me anymore!
-I'm just following orders.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.500
I'll leave as soon as the case is over.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.000
As you wish.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.790
I have only one requirement:

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.870
follow my orders.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.280
I only follow reasonable orders.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.700
Organizing old case files
is a reasonable order?

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.370
If we can get useful information
from them, then it's reasonable.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.770
The case files you want to find
aren't here.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.600
We have a new colleague.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.410
You know her.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.910
A new colleague? Who?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.550
Any new information

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.150
from Liu Jialiang's mother?

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.400
I went to Liu's mother's house,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.930
but no one was living there.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.630
According to the neighbors,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.790
they haven't seen anyone there
for at least 6 months.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.720
Can I jump in here?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.910
What case is this?

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.700
The body you found
on the back hill yesterday

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.790
is Liu Jialiang,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.870
the director of Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.840
It's him?

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.720
That elderly lady
I was looking for yesterday

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.960
is also from their nursing home.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.870
What else?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.910
Other than that,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.440
the conditions at their nursing home
are very poor.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.080
I'm asking

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.680
if there are any new leads
on Liu Jialiang.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.030
He rarely interacted with people
before his death.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.960
I only heard that he borrowed
a lot of money recently,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.890
but no one knows what he used it for.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.350
Get in the car.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.660
Where are we going?

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.230
Yongning Street Landfill.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.230
There's been another murder there.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.560
Thank you.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.340
Hello, where can I find Dr. Ding?

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.510
In all of Shanghai, only Dr. Ding

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.970
has such a strong stomach.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.790
Thanks.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.520
A new face.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.950
Hello, Dr. Ding.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.320
I'm the new police officer.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.450
My name is Lu Yizhen.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.320
Lu Yizhen?

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.160
What's the situation with the victim?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.670
This victim has

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.400
the same mark

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.280
on his forehead as Liu Jialiang.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.910
However, Liu Jialiang was
starved to death,

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.200
while this victim

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.440
is covered in wounds.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.300
Preliminary assessment suggests

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.090
he was repeatedly beaten

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.920
with a blunt object, like a club.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.250
Additionally, his left hand is fractured.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.200
Look, just a body dumped here.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.620
What's the preliminary cause of death?

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.000
Likely internal organ damage
from the beating,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.079
combined with excessive blood loss.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.950
The estimated time of death

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.160
was about a day ago.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.150
What do you think?

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.240
Lu Yizhen.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.079
What's your opinion?

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.310
Me?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.589
Just based on the same markings...

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.609
I think it could be the same killer.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:28.920
But the MO is different,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920
so these two cases might not have been

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.440
committed by the same person.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.160
It could also be

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
a copycat who saw the news reports.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.750
I think our primary task now is...

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.330
to determine the relationship...

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.110
between the two victims.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.570
Only then can we establish

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.050
a link to the killer.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920
If you were in charge,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.460
where would you start?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.750
I would...

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.440
Inspector...

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.240
Thank you.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.750
Dr. Ding, thank you.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.880
It's okay.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.050
At a scene like this,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.440
you're already doing remarkably well.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.550
Crime scenes like this

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.210
have always been men's territory.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.300
I'm happy to see a female officer.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.790
With you around, I'm not alone anymore.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.440
If you have any problems,
come to me anytime.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.100
I'll definitely help you out.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.730
Especially with ways to deal with him.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.530
If you can't handle it,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.310
I can apply to Director Huo

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.970
to have you transferred back.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.680
After all, investigating cases
in the field

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.310
means facing situations like this
all the time.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.550
It's not like reviewing old case files
in the office.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.240
Why do you always talk like...

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.770
No need.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.660
I'm fine.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.310
Inspector Guan.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.820
The victim, Zhou Yongjie, 26 years old,
was unemployed.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.280
Based on his home address,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.990
he should have lived around here.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.190
This area is near Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.410
Liu Jialiang died around here.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.180
Dong,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.690
take some people and look into

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.920
all of Zhou Yongjie's movements
before his death.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.320
Got it.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.720
Lu Yizhen.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.070
You,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.280
come with me to find
Zhou Yongjie's father.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.640
I... I request to team up with Dong.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.380
I have experience
investigating whereabouts.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.210
I... I want to go with him.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.610
Request denied.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.450
Alright.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.130
If there's nothing else, let's move out.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.590
Okay.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.190
Tell me,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.390
why do you insist on keeping me with you?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.380
Haven't I told you before?

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.460
You just need to follow my orders

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.720
and document the case details properly.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.120
You have no authority here.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.300
I never thought...

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.110
this would be...

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.010
the last photo...

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.680
-of our Yongjie and me.
-My condolences.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.750
Mr. Zhou.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.460
This set of keys...

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.260
is certainly not for our home.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.980
[Guangqi Nursing Home Back Door;
Storage Room]

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.070
These should be all the keys

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.470
to Guangqi Nursing Home.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.730
Why would Yongjie have these?

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.490
Are you sure this is the place?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.240
Not sure.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.110
I've never been here either.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.640
Don't move!

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.000
Don't move!

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.100
Who are you?

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.560
Don't move!

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.960
Officers, how did you get in here?

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.830
Who is she?

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.890
I don't know.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.400
This concerns a serious case.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.030
If you conceal information,
I have the authority to arrest you!

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.760
This is Director Liu's mother.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.080
Let me take care of her.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.300
It's okay.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.180
It's okay now.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.470
It's alright.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.270
The director locked her up here
6 months ago.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.130
Sometimes, I'd steal the director's keys

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.390
to bring her some food.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.720
When you came that day,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.180
I didn't have time to lock the door back,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.140
so she ran out.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.110
The director forbade anyone
from asking about her.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.240
Your nursing home's

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.400
living conditions and hygiene
are terrible.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.180
You call this elder care?

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.310
This is elder abuse!

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.240
The director embezzled all the donations

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.200
for himself.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.020
I couldn't do anything about it.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.170
It's okay now. Don't be afraid.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.000
Take them to the hospital first.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.060
Yizhen!

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.060
What happened?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.050
How did you end up like this?

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.780
It's nothing. Isn't this normal?

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.110
Put this on.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.640
What?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.590
Why should I wear your white coat?

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.520
Then take it off.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.640
Dr. Si, I'm really fine.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.160
I'll wash it
and bring it back to you later.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.220
You're fussing over me like a mother.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.270
Alright.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.510
Don't worry about things here.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.010
I'll arrange for them to get examined.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.740
And take care of yourself as well.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.030
Don't get tricked!

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.250
Inspector.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.380
Inspector.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.050
Dr. Ding found something.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.720
Ding Eryi.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.170
I've found

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.480
that Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie had

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.400
large amounts of barbiturates
in their bodies.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.480
This is a prescription sedative.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.850
Its effects are somewhat similar
to alcohol.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.910
It can make people go from mild drowsiness

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.460
to loss of pain sensation

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.900
and finally unconsciousness.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.780
So you mean

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.330
both victims

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.770
were given large doses of sedatives
before death?

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.570
That's right.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.790
Such a high dosage

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.230
would cause dizziness, vomiting,
unconsciousness,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.880
and even death.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.770
Also, take a look at these.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.580
The marks on both victims' foreheads

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.690
are completely identical in size,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:07.950
angle, and depth.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.100
Inspector!

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.020
Inspector.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.170
Someone spotted Zhou Yongjie

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.780
being taken away by people
from the Xingbei Society.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.710
Here's the information
on the Xingbei Society.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.160
This society was established
by some well-dressed hoodlums.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.070
To put it bluntly, they're all just

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.870
a bunch of troublemaking thugs.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.560
Their leader is called Long,

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.440
and he uses gambling dens
to rake in money.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.000
The donations Director Liu pocketed
from the nursing home—

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.330
could Long have something to do with that?

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.440
Show me the case details you've compiled.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.650
My friend just took my jacket,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.010
and my notebook is in it.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.930
Is this how you act as a detective?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.410
Inspector,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.290
the case files you want to see
are all here.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.060
Why don't you come take a look?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.750
Besides,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.320
I believe Yizhen

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.350
is quite familiar with these cases.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.800
If you don't believe me,
ask her about any detail.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.130
She'll know it for sure.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.700
Right?

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:12.880
Dong.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.200
Go track down Long.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.400
Okay, I'm on it.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.550
Let's go to the hospital.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:20.960
Okay.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.900
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.520
Lu Yizhen.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.680
Where are they?

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.170
The nurse said they're upstairs.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.220
Lu Yizhen!

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.590
Mom?

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.640
When... When did you come to Shanghai?

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.200
If I hadn't come sooner,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.220
you'd have been hurt by this man again!

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.020
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.030
He's my superior now. Don't talk nonsense.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:58.830
Superior?

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.790
Since when did he become your superior?

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.350
Yizhen,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.150
as soon as you get involved with this man,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.280
you'll be in danger!

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.800
Don't you know that?

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.640
I'm still working on a case. I'm busy.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.590
Mom, please go home first.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.640
What case?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.790
What kind of case could you two
possibly investigate together?

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.200
You...

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.400
I'm telling you, I forbid you to go!

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.660
Inspector, I'm sorry.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.880
I need to handle this first.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.070
Could you please go ahead without me?

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.070
I'll be back soon.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.510
Ma'am, I'll be going now.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.640
Let's talk at home.
Don't make a scene here.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.110
So you do know it's embarrassing!

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.110
Then listen to me!

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.160
Pack your things right now

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.640
and go back to Nanyang with me!

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.270
I won't allow you to
spend another second with him!

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:38.920
Yizhen?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.480
Mrs. Lu,

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.210
when did you come to Shanghai?

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.030
Si Min,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.510
you've come at the right time.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.920
Please help me convince Yizhen

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.480
to go back to Nanyang with me

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.680
Mom.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.470
I have a job in Shanghai.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.800
I need to investigate cases.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.890
I'm busy every day.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.440
Why must you drag me back to Nanyang?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.160
Are you done making a scene?

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.880
If you want to go back to Nanyang,
please go by yourself.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.240
You... Come back here!

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.270
Mrs. Lu!

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.790
Mrs. Lu!

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.790
What's wrong?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.590
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.300
Yizhen.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.030
Let's go to my office
so she can rest for a while.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.560
Let's go.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.180
It's nothing serious, Mrs. Lu.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.040
But you should still rest a lot
for the next few days.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.910
Okay.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.960
That's good to hear.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.820
Take my mom home for me later.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.920
I need to get back to work.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.450
Go ahead.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.920
I'm off, Mom.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.510
Stop right there!

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.540
Are you still going to find him?

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.380
Why... Why won't you just listen?

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.160
I'm just investigating a case
under his supervision, that's all.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.400
Nothing else.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.240
Investigating a case?

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.640
What case could you two
possibly be investigating together?

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.400
Lu Yizhen,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.830
don't think I don't know

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.490
what you're really thinking!

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.550
I just want to investigate that case.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.090
I just want to know the truth.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.420
What's wrong with that?

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.100
We didn't do anything wrong, Mom.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.640
We shouldn't be the ones suffering.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.070
I want to know the truth.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.240
I want to know about my past.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.750
Why won't you allow it?

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.440
I...

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.110
I don't want you

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.680
to get hurt again.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.920
Am I wrong for that?

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.310
Mom...

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.110
Alright, alright, Mrs. Lu.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.070
These days, Yizhen

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.790
has brought many elderly people
from a nursing home

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.520
to our hospital for check-ups.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.440
She needs to check on
those elderly people, right?

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.480
I promise

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.570
she'll be completely safe this time.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.680
Si Min,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.160
y-you're not lying to me, are you?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.110
Of course not.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.480
Don't you trust me?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.300
How about this?

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.160
Let's go home first.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.240
We'll prepare something delicious
and wait for her to come back.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.210
Go on, hurry.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.640
I'll go check on those elderly people.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.350
Go on.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.190
I'll be home late, Mom.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.530
[Keep Quiet]

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.510
Stop right there!

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.110
Move aside! Move aside!

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.110
Long...

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.070
Long...

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:27.760
Out of my way!

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.840
Move!

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.880
Let go of me!

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.710
Do you know who I am?
How dare you arrest me!

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:42.470
Let go of me!

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.880
It's exactly because I know who you are

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.920
that I'm arresting you!

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.480
Tell me,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.160
were you involved in the deaths

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.330
of Zhou Yongjie and Liu Jialiang?

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.110
Nonsense! I don't even know them!

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.960
Let go of me!

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.720
Let go of me now!

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.580
If you don't talk now,
you won't get another chance.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.480
Inspector Guan?

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.160
I'll talk.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.020
I'll talk.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.030
Those two guys

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.310
were cheating at my gambling den,

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.310
and I caught them.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.100
They owed me a lot of money.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:08.880
Yes,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.510
I did go after them for the money,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.800
but I never laid a finger on them!

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.290
Now that they're dead,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.680
I don't even know
who to collect from anymore.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.200
I...

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.040
Take him away.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.270
Yes, sir.
