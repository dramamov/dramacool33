00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.390

No strenuous exercise for 3–4 weeks

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.490
and avoid greasy food.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.520
Take care of the wound
to prevent scarring.

What's wrong with him?

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.930
He has gallstone disease.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.380
His gallbladder has to be removed.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.030
He needs a surgery?

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.650
He must've been in pain for days.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.170
How did he put up with it for so long?

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.510
The inflammation is serious,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.570
so he'll need laparoscopic surgery.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.170
If you agree,
we'll go ahead with it right away.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.680

If he doesn't get surgery,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.840
will he die?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.770
It'd bother me

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.360
if you died when you've been with me.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.390
What about the surgery fee?

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.270
Is your life worth only 4 million?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.730
I'm saying this because
it's not worth 4 million.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.770
That's why you just
stupidly put up with the pain?

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.200
I thought it was nothing.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.380

I've paid for it.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.520
I'll pay you back.

So don't piss me off.

Why do you let me stay with you?

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.770
I'd never visited Uncle
since he'd collapsed.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.140
I don't want to feel any guilt about it.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.480

Wow.

What's the big deal about
cousins living together?

That's not it.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.290
What's surprising is
you living with anybody at all.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.450
Don't you hate living with others?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.740
That's why you moved out early.

No.

How did you get him to agree?

In my house.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.070
Because I pitied him.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.750
You know how he is.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.580
He's a fool who'd rather die
than get surgery because he's broke.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.660
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.340
Nothing beats family
who takes care of you, right?

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.890
Don't mind it.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.650
He's super rich.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.390
Stop talking nonsense.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.790
It's not nonsense.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.180
Why don't you get him a job
at your company?

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.750
Oops...

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.600
Is it still a secret that
you're the CEO's son?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.920
Hey.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.730
Just shut up and drink.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.910
Okay.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.340
You know,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.840
you've been quiet lately.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.470
Not seeing anyone?

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.280
Is Jeonghan popular?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.060
Well,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.560
this little brat has no manners,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.020
but I guess
it's what people like these days.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.500
He's handsome.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.600
I mean, he must be popular
because he's handsome.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.070
Let's go for a smoke.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.840
Avoid greasy food. Eat this instead.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.950
What's so funny?

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.910
Your cousin is quite cute.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.070
How is he cute?

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.690
He's so annoying.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.440
How should I put it?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.640
He's not like young people nowadays.
He's simple and pure.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.760
That's what I'm into lately.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.160
It's not tiring.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.550
They don't play mind games.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.410
Everything is straightforward.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.030
Then take him home and live together.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.500
Should I?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.580
It should be fun living with him.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:25.690
Let's go in.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.890
Okay.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.500
Hey, Seo Jeonghan.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.200
Are you okay?

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.420
Ah! I have to go!

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.250
I'm drunk.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.670
Mr. Iljo— No...

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.490
-Iljo.
-Yes?

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.280
I'll get going.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.360
See you around.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.440
Gosh, I'm so drunk.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.460
Sir, bill, please!

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.680
And... he'll be paying.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.680
Hey, Jeonghan. Time to go, yeah?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.190
Get up.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.880
Come on. Get up!

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.630
Darn it.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.760
Hey, try to walk properly...

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.320
Sir, you haven't paid the bill.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.120
U-Uh, hang on.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.550
Here.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.600
Hey, stand upright, Jeonghan.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.320
Walk properly, can you?

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.180
Seo Jeonghan!

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.110
Can't you walk properly?
Don't you know I'm sick?

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.730
W-What...

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.420
What's wrong?

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.930
Seriously...

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.050
Walk properly!

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.100
Does it hurt?

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.640
Where are you going?

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.000
What are you doing?

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.360
Bite on this.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.770
Don't move.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.740
Stay still.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.320
Good boy.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.790
You're drunk.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.960
Quiet.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.220
[In the next episode]

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.450
I've started a part-time job.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.340
Jeonghan.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.180
I didn't know it was your company.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.720
It was the only place that
responded to my job application.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880
What now?
What else are you hiding from me?

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.080
Don't you...

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.990
remember?

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.200
Remember?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.270
I remember now.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.380
I was drunk and crossed the line.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.540
I'll help you.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.320
Tell me.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.420
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.500
Kiss me.
