The higher-ups asked me to handle

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.940
some more important matters.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.710
So I'll hand over

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.810
my current tasks to you.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.580
You two shake hands first.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.070
He's called Captain.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.280
Butcher.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.980
Remember,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.920
from today on, you two will be

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.070
on an equal footing.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.470
You two are part of the Chamber

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.640
and also my people.

[Episode 15]

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.190
I bought it back.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.280
Lu Yizhen, you've disappointed me so much.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.470
You didn't keep your word.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.670
I won't see you again.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.240
Hello?

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:39.550
Hello?

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.079
No.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.360
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.910
This is a good opportunity

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.120
for us to get the latest lead.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.920
And it's currently
the only chance we have.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.810
I remember her face.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.080
She was the woman

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.800
who danced with Zhuo Feng
at the alumni gathering.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.520
I didn't arrest her at the time

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.800
because I wanted to see

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.100
what she was really up to.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100
No.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.190
What do you think?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.210
We can give it a try.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.910
Lu Yizhen.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.310
Lu Yizhen.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.000
-I'm sorry.
-Stop nagging.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.560
Lu Yizhen.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.960
I can't possibly let you go alone.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.090
Besides, we don't even know who she is.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.410
This woman is no ordinary person.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.020
She even
knows counter-surveillance techniques.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.680
Before meeting you,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.030
she first checked
if you were being followed.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.030
When she spotted a car following you,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.230
she immediately canceled the meeting.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.780
I acted on my own initiative.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.870
The thought occurred to me suddenly,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.130
so I didn't notify you.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.400
We just had a glimmer of hope,
and it vanished again.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400
Not necessarily.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.520
This woman's tried to see you a few times.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.150
She must have something important
she needs your help with.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.960
Have your people look for her

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.080
and see if they can find her whereabouts.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.140
Alright, I'll arrange it right away.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.600
Don't worry.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.630
I promise you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.560
I will definitely find this woman.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.500
Then you must promise me

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.070
you won't hide any details

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.430
about this case from me.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.040
Okay.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.020
Mr. Zhuo, here's what happened.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.630
That day,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.560
by the time I got into the prison,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.390
I found our men

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.040
and Ghost
had already been killed by Tang Jiahao.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
I was too late.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.540
I... I couldn't do anything about it.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.020
Why didn't you
tell me about this at the time?

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.600
Well, Tang Jiahao threatened me.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.040
He threatened you?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.830
He threatened you,
and you got scared of him?

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.530
No, it's not that I got scared of him.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.130
It was because of their boss.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.480
This matter
is getting more and more interesting.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.800
I always thought there was something fishy

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.530
about that fire case back then.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.950
Only Ghost escaped.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.250
It's been so long,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.480
but there are still some things

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.840
I can't figure out even now.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.680
He must have some secrets.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.390
Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.480
Tang Jiahao into the prison

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.800
to kill Ghost so brazenly.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.080
You must thoroughly investigate him.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.380
Since you understand things so clearly,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.350
you sit in this chair.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.260
Mr. Zhuo, well...

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.840
I've said all I need to say.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.830
If there's nothing else,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.080
I'll take my leave first.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.720
Mr. Zhuo!

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
I've told you everything, Mr. Zhuo!

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.870
You made me lose face
in front of the Chamber.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.000
Shouldn't you

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.750
help me vent my anger?

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.120
No, Mr. Zhuo!

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.360
Mr. Zhuo!

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.050
Mr. Zhuo, listen to me!

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.710
You can't go back on your word!

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.140
Mr. Zhuo!

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.920
Mr. Zhuo.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.000
Should we report this to the Chamber?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.800
Report to the Chamber?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.480
Do you want the Chamber to know

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.610
that I can't even handle my own people?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.000
Do you know how many people in Shanghai

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.510
are eyeing my business?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.270
Understood.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.480
Tell everyone to load their guns.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.480
If you see Tang Jiahao,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.920
shoot to kill!

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.680
Yes.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.470
Wait, what's going on?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.950
Whoever came in must be really tough.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.470
I'm telling you.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.580
This man is Tang Jiahao.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.630
He's a mad dog. I know him!

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:44.870
I know him better than you do.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.480
Let me go.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.360
I'll help you.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.430
He won't be able to hurt you.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.560
This... This...

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.870
You want to kill me?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.360
I'll stab you to death!

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.190
You understand?

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.510
Screw you!

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:53.960
Let's go!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.550
Tang Jiahao!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.120
Show yourself!

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.870
You coward!

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.940
Show yourself!

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.690
You and your boss betrayed the Chamber.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.000
Do you think you can escape?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.050
We won't escape.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.650
We'll just kill all of you.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.790
I'm Guan Cen, an inspector
from the Police Station.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.550
You made the call?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.200
Yes.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.440
You're finally here.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.300
What happened?

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.600
Please come in and take a look.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.630
Our clinic seems to have been burglarized.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.150
Hurry.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.720
Come in.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.360
Have you contacted your doctor,
Huang Kaiyuan?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.270
I tried, but I couldn't reach him.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.500
That's why I reported it
and called you here.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.870
When did you lose contact with him?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.120
This morning.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.820
He said he wasn't feeling well

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.220
and told me
to cancel all his appointments.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.530
Later, I found the room was burglarized,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.860
and I haven't been able
to reach him since.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.320
If it were theft,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.800
they wouldn't have only searched one room.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.480
You mean he messed it up himself?

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.750
Not necessarily.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.480
But if it was him,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.010
he must have left in a hurry.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.360
Is this appointment register

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360
yours?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.720
Let me see.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.000
Yes.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.600
But besides the people on the list,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.790
there's also a regular client
who doesn't need an appointment.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.510
He's been coming frequently lately.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.440
What's his name?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.700
Um...

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.240
Mr. Zhuo, Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.770
The person who received me last time
wasn't you.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.080
Is there another nurse?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.750
There's another nurse surnamed Yang.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.360
She started working here not long ago.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.420
Why isn't she here?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.670
I don't know.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.440
She just suddenly didn't show up for work
without reason.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.120
I don't have her contact information.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.180
I don't know her home address either.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200
What's her name?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.220
Yang Xiaolin.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.120
Whose bracelet is this?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.480
It's Ms. Yang's.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.510
Why was it left there?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.520
What's wrong?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.360
The woman who gave me the clue

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
at the restaurant that day

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.550
was wearing an identical silver bracelet.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.960
The woman who danced with Zhuo Feng?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.480
Yes.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600
Could she be Huang Kaiyuan's nurse?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.360
So Huang Kaiyuan's nurse,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.270

Very likely.

But what clue would she want to give me?

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.990

There are signs of a fierce struggle
at the scene.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.220
The killer was extremely brutal.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240

To be able to kill them like this

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.150
shows how terrifyingly capable
the killer is.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.000
If the goal was just to kill,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.080
there was no need to be so brutal.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.840

The distance from this door to that wall

is about 5 steps.

It's only about 2 steps.

The 3-step gap in the middle
can't be solid.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.680
Thank you.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.750
Hello?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.770
Inspector,

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.160
Director Du speculated earlier

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.560
there should be
more than one hiding place.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.960
Based on our clues now,

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.760
we've identified a few places.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.480
If we're going to arrest them,
we'll have to nab them all at once.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.140
Otherwise, we'll alert them.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.750
But we're short-handed right now,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.510
so we don't dare act rashly.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.920
Wait for me.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.590
I'll bring people over now.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.110
Seems we can't

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.170
get any useful information from him.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.110
Judging from his condition,

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.150
it isn't just physical injuries.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.530
The greater trauma is psychological.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.830
He's in such a state of extreme fear,

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.980
so we can't
get any useful information from him.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.970
Why don't we ask Dr. Gu for help?

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.990
He should
understand this condition better.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.460
He might be able to help us.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.200
That was Dong on the phone just now?

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:56.640
Yes.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.270
They found a few suspected hiding places,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.640
but they are short-handed
and don't dare act rashly.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
I need to go check it out.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.720
I'll tell Dr. Gu to come here
while I'm at it.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.260
You go ahead.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.260
I'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.270
I'll be back soon.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.310
Be careful.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.240
This...

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.270
Sir.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.360
Sir,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.820
we're closed.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.030
Sir, you...

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.110
Sir, what... what are you looking for?

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.510
Just... Just tell me
and I'll get it for you.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.030
Sir,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.070
this is for my own use.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.400
Sir,

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.590
this...

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.350
It's yours.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.510
S-Sir.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.920
Officer Lu.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.610
Have some water.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:51.960
Thank you.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.540
If you get tired, just let us know.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.560
We can help you
keep an eye on him for a while.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.030
Okay.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.010
Do you have wet towels
and medical kits here?

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.960
I'll go look for them for you in a moment.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.400
Okay.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.890
If our people arrive,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.490
just bring them in directly.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.350
No problem.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.350
Give me the key to his handcuffs.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.400
Officer Lu, the key...

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.030
Don't let his injuries fool you.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.320
He can be quite terrifying
when he loses control.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.920
It's fine.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.920
Officer Lu,

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.980
there are more outside.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.440
I can bring them in if you need.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440
These are enough.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.510
Be careful then.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.520
If anything happens, just call us.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.430
Thank you.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.350
You're welcome.
