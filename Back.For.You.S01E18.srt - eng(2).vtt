00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Say a proper goodbye.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.760
We said a proper goodbye.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.960
I even wiped the mic at the station.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.040
And swept the floor, too.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.400
How did it turn out?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.200
Honestly, the school radio

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.800
doesn't get many listeners, right?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.280
Really?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.880
But I promise

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.640
everyone listened closely tonight.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.280
Hope it won't trouble Lou.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm a little scared.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.160
I was too impulsive just now.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.880
Don't worry, it won't.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.320
Why are you so sure?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.400
You've been on air for over ten minutes.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.840
If the teachers had a problem,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480
they would've come in and pulled you out.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.440
They're all adults.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.720
Everyone knows their limits.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.880
Can't imagine what you'll be like in the future.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.880
You already act like an adult.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.920
Relax.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.400
I won't change.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.880
I'll stay the same as now.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.400
Let me walk you to the bus.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400
It's the last bus.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.040
Sure.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.520
But—

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.640
Buy me milk tea and I'll get on.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.760
Then we'll miss the bus.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.160
So what if we miss it?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.760
I even gave you a head massage last night.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.280
You owe me a proper thank you.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.280
The first time lasted one day.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.440
The second time, two days.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.680
But this time, it's been half a month.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.440
At this rate—

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.840
What about this time?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.600
Will it last even longer now?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.000
Whatever.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.120
I'll go back sooner or later anyway.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.360
The longer I stay here,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.720
the more I can do.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.480
But all these things I do—

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.240
do they really matter?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.320
No matter how much I do now,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.320
can I really help her?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.240
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.120
You have to believe in yourself.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.880
We can overcome this.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.880
We said a proper goodbye.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.120
We said a proper goodbye.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.560
I even wiped the mic at the station.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.200
And swept the floor, too.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.520
It must mean something.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.360
Even if I can't do anything,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.640
these good memories

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.880
can make her happy.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.880
Anyway—

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.080
I want her to be as happy as possible.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.640
When girls have birthdays,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.920
what gifts do they like?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.760
Su Ruo, right?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.360
Her birthday's got nothing to do with me.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.880
I really don't get this stuff.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.040
She's such a nice classmate.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.920
Her parents are gone.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.080
First birthday all alone.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.080
If she doesn't get a gift,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.200
she'll feel so sad.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.240
A thoughtful gift—

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.800
any girl would love it.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.760
How about I sing her a song?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.600
Why listen to you sing?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.640
You might as well buy her a CD.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.160
My song doesn't belong to this era.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.360
If I don't sing it,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.400
you can't hear it anywhere.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.920
Are you saying your song is ahead of its time?

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560
Didn't know you were so full of yourself.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.200
Can you play guitar?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.440
Nope.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.600
But I can hum it.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.760
I need someone to teach me guitar.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.400
Can you?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.680
Sure.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.760
Yeah, right.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.920
I really need someone to teach me.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.120
Give me your love, should I or not?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.720
I'm like a speck of dust.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.920
Hoping you'll come to me.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.840
Ren Nan.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.320
I want to learn a song.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.960
Can you teach me guitar?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.160
If you want to learn a song,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.760
just buy a songbook and practice.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.000
My song won't be in any bookstore.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.200
I wrote it myself.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560
I can hum it.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.480
Back to where it all began.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.480
In my memory, your smile is so sweet.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.640
Your profile under the stars.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.840
Memories drift away with the wind.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.960
I admit, your songwriting is pretty legit.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.880
But singing—

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.720
really doesn't suit you.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800
Don't sing next time.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.160
Thanks.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.840
Just this once.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.640
As for me—

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.680
I can teach you guitar.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.000
But—

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.400
I want to do a cover, too.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.000
Is that okay?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.480
I want to sing it at a private event

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.360
in a few days.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.320
Do you mind?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.560
Non-profit events are totally fine.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.280
The copyright is still yours.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.720
It's not really mine.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.320
Then hum it again.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.880
Back to where it all began.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.960
In my memory, your smile is so sweet.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.600
Zhang Jie.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.960
Where did Yu Xingchen go?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.160
No idea.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.040
He's been practicing guitar all day lately.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.400
No clue where he's hanging out.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.560
Yu Xingchen.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.520
No evening self-study tonight?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.640
What are you doing tonight?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.560
No plans.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.760
I'll just go home and study.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.120
Doesn't he know it's my birthday?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.360
Your birthday's in the second half, right?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.720
When it's my birthday, everyone's graduated.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.720
How did you celebrate before?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.240
I usually—

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.320
I usually don't celebrate anymore.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.000
I'm too old for that now.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.400
Nothing worth celebrating.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.960
Su Ruo, happy birthday.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.880
Thank you.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.720
Let me treat you to dinner.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.400
No need, really.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.480
Someone once told me

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.440
you don't need to celebrate birthdays when you're grown up.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.160
So I stopped celebrating.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.160
I'm going home to study.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.120
I'm heading out first.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.600
Su Ruo.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.240
I know the Gaokao is coming soon.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.360
Everyone should focus on studying.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.560
But everyone only turns eighteen

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.680
once in their life.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.960
It shouldn't just pass by carelessly.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.600
I just hope

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.760
you have no regrets on your eighteenth birthday.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.280
If you really don't want to be alone with me,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.280
I can invite our classmates too.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.760
Thank you, Ren Nan.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.920
After we eat, I'll walk you home.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.320
Don't worry.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.440
I won't bother you again before the Gaokao.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.600
What?

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.280
Are you really going to her place for a surprise?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.120
How's your playing going?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.840
For this piece,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.320
it's already pretty good.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.240
Keep it secret.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.720
Who cares to tell?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.080
Darn it.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.240
Come in, come in! Hurry, hurry!

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.720
It actually looks great.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.360
Ren Nan.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.120
You're really thoughtful.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.880
Booking such a big room for us to sing,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.520
and even decorating it.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.520
Yeah, it's so over the top.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040
Be honest.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.280
What's really going on?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.880
Lately,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.320
I've seen everyone working so hard.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.040
So I wanted us to have some fun.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.800
Get together.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.840
Come on, come on.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.840
Come on, come on.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.680
Let's all toast, everyone!

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.800
Why does this feel a bit strange?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.680
What's strange about it?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.440
It's all endless love for Class 3.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.240
Well said.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.680
Let's toast to Class 3!

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.560
Cheers!

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.120
No need to bring in the cake.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.560
You all can share it yourselves.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.680
Let's go, let's go.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.120
Go.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.800
After we eat, I'll walk you home.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.160
Thank you, Ren Nan.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.200
But I really don't want to go.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.360
I'm not coming. I need to study.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.440
Eight dishes.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.560
A full eight dishes!

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.080
You've caused quite a stir this time.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.560
I just wanted to treat you all.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.120
Come on, try it!

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.480
By the way,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.120
I have to go out tonight.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.840
A classmate is having a birthday.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.960
I'm going to celebrate.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.720
I'll be back later.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.480
See, what did I tell you?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320
Whose birthday is it?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.960
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.960
A girl.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.920
Yu Xingchen.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.480
The Gaokao is almost here.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.560
Don't pull this now, okay?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.000
Alright.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.120
I'll be honest.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.280
It's Su Ruo.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.120
Take these with you.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.480
Take this too.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.360
No, no, no.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.600
We don't need the hotpot.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.920
Hotpot keeps you warm.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.720
Come on, take it.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.280
Where did you get this?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.600
I just sat down,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.200
and my seat felt weird.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.240
Then I found this.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.360
It's a kind of surprise, I guess.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.360
You put thought into it.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.560
But Ren Nan,

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.720
I think with Gaokao coming up,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.840
we should focus on studying.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.440
If you need help,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.960
I can make time to tutor you.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.960
You and I,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.360
we're still just classmates.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.600
Is that okay with you?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920
Hui Ge.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.640
Aren't you overthinking this?

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.640
At first, I didn't get it either.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.160
Why you made such wild guesses.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.960
And such a big show.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.360
But now I understand.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.200
You invited so many classmates

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.200
to hide your real motive.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.960
That must've been tough for you.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.800
The gift box was prepared with care.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.720
But I don't like pink.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.800
And

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.920
this really doesn't suit me.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.880
Sorry.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.720
We'll always be friends.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.440
What kind of trouble have I made?
