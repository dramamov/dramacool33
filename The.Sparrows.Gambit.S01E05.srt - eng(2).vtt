00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.060
Wenbin,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.460
this kiss belongs to me!

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.860
Wenbin.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.300

There's a fire!

This way! Run this way!

What's going on here?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.220
Sir,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.060
the rooms upstairs
have been cleared out.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.460
Just as you anticipated.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.700
The auction didn't go smoothly.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.380
And the biggest scandal is...

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.780
is...

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.180
What?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.700
Marshal Chen kissed that woman!

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.300
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.260
Why are you telling me this?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.700
That same woman

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.220
was the one who won the Blycher Hotel.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.700
What did she look like?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.780
She wore a mask the whole time.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.060
Never got a clear look at her face.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.380
It seems someone really has us
in their sights.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.020
Doesn't matter.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.420
What our Wang family cannot obtain,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.500
no one else will have it either.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.300
What about the secret room?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.660
We've placed the oil barrels in it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.540
It will burn to ash

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.620
for sure.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.140

All the evidence in Blycher Hotel
is gone.

At least the word is all

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.620
about Chen Wenbin and a woman

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.100
locking lips at the auction.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.660
It seems no flaws in the plan.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.100
I think Chen Wenbin can save you.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.780
He's not one of the Wangs.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.180
He's just the string

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.860
pulling Wang Wan'er, his puppet.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.540
My task now

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.020
is to use that very string

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.300
to tighten around Wang Wan'er's neck

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.100
until she can't breathe.

Miss Liu doesn't know what to do.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.900

Marshal Chen drank too much
with a woman.

Marshal Chen is your fiancé.

You're the most suitable to handle this.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.020
I heard about the Blycher Hotel.

What do you mean?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.020
Are you calling me stupid?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.460
No.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.580
You're my best friend

Fine. Help me investigate.

I'll have someone bring him back.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.420
As for that woman,

if you have any news,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.100
find me at Wangs' Chamber of Commerce
on Xinyuan Road.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.980
Okay.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.300
I'll definitely find her for you.

Okay.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.340
You've handled the recent matters

quite well.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.460
When Military Governor Chen returns,

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.220
we should move forward with

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.340
your marriage to Wenbin.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.180
I've heard Wenbin has been

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.660
getting very close to a woman lately.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.620
Is that true?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.260
You

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.060
don't tell me
you can't even manage a man.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.220
Then you'd truly be useless.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.500
I won't.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.660
I'm already looking into it.

You'd better be.

The Blycher Hotel burned down.

The opium was destroyed.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.860
We've lost a lot of money.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.300
If we don't recoup the losses quickly,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.620
our Wang family will be finished soon.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.220
I'll be straight with you.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.620
This shipment is meant
to balance the books.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.860
So nothing can go wrong.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.900
The date is the seventh of this month.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.780
You'll handle it personally again.
Understood?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.180
Understood.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.260
Who is there?

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.420
Looks like he ran that way! After him!

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.220
Miss Liu,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.620
I just saved you.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.060
How will you repay me?

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.220
Marshal Chen,
what would you like as repayment?

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.660
That depends on your sincerity.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.180
Keep searching!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.860
You must catch that person!

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.220
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.940
I heard there was a thief here.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.020
So I came to the kitchen to check.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.100
I didn't expect

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.660
to run into you, Miss Liu.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.020
I heard it too.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.260
But that eavesdropping thief was
by the window.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.700
His shoes must be covered
in grass clippings.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.700
Don't be careless.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.980
Miss Liu, it seems you're very concerned
about the Wang family.
