00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.243
(Baekseung Action School)

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:04.167
Hey, did you guys hear?

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.417
Jae-yeon's going to train that idol.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.083
I heard he's a total jerk.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.958
If you do a good job,
won't this put you on the map?

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:12.500
Hello.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.042
I'm Gu Jae-yeon.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:15.583
The director was injured,

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:17.708
so I'll be in charge of training for now.

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.333
You're just a substitute,
and you have such an average build.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:23.292
Can you even teach me properly?

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:25.250
I'll just wait for the
director to come back.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.292
If I train you seriously,

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:30.833
can you even keep up?

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.198
What do you think you're doing?

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.167
Then, let's begin the lesson.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.333
Change it.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:43.333
What?

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.625
That weird t-shirt.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.042
The t-shirt is the problem.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:47.250
Come on out.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.375
- Hey...
- Excuse me.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.500
Hey!

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:50.833
Let me change your shirt for you.

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:51.958
Okay.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.333
Let go.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.458
Let's just be honest with each other.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.375
You don't want to train me anyway, right?

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.333
Well...

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:02.958
I'm not exactly thrilled about it.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.083
(Moon Do-ha assaults member)
I heard some things...

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:05.958
about you, Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.283
(Is it normal to hit members?)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500
But this is a job.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.768
Whether you like it or not, you
do it. That's being a professional.

00:01:11.792 --> 00:01:13.500
That's exactly the problem.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:15.375
Professionals work with professionals.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.583
Do you really think you're
qualified to train me?

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.458
Push.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:20.583
Dodge.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.208
Punch.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.083
Watch your opponent.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.583
Kick.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.000
You did pretty well.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.333
For a beginner.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:29.708
What? That was nothing.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:30.708
Can I get a refund?

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.875
All right, let's pick up the pace now.

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:34.292
What?

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:36.292
Focus.

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:37.167
Attack! Defend!

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.625
Defend.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.750
Dodge.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.167
Focus!

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.833
I'm not sure what you mean by "qualified,"
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.998
But it looks like you won't
be needing that refund.

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.750
So, as planned, I'll be
teaching the next class.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.708
No need.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.542
I don't like you.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.542
So either cancel the contract
or get me a new instructor.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.917
And the reason is?

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:12.208
You're not going to...

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.208
throw a tantrum on the
floor like a child, are you?

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.208
You really think you can beat me?

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.792
I dance for hours every single day.

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:24.750
Do you think just anyone can be an idol?

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:25.958
So...

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.458
if I lose, that's your excuse
to get a new instructor?

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.958
It's not an excuse.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.603
The instructor simply lacks the skill.

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.208
Is there a better reason than that?

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.208
First one back wins.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:37.375
Ten laps.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.375
Ten laps. First one back wins.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Ready...

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.417
Go!

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.958
You okay?

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.167
I heard your answer loud and clear.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.167
Replace him.

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:11.500
Do-ha, the filming schedule is all out.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.025
You have to film self-made content
in the action school.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.583
Hurry up and go.

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:19.125
Good work today, everyone.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:20.458
Gu Jae-yeon.

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.500
You're filming with Moon Do-ha.

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:23.250
Filming?

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.208
Isn't he an idol?

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:26.375
He said he wanted to
film some training footage.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.708
So I said yes.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:28.833
What else did he say?

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:31.125
Ah, "Ja-con".
[Short for: Self-made content]

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.250
Anyway, that day is an outdoor
training session for everyone.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:35.000
Dismissed.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.792
Good work.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:39.000
Jak-heon?

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.083
Jak-heon.
[He typed the wrong word.]

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.833
"To pour wine and offer
it to the gods at a festival."
[Also did not use MZ dictionary.]

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:48.458
What does that even mean?

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.417
Twenty-six.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:50.375
Twenty-seven.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.375
Twenty-eight.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Twenty-nine.

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:53.542
Thirty.

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:55.208
Left foot, again.

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:56.958
Again. Two.

00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:57.833
Why is it always "two"?!

00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:58.500
Two.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:00.809
Does that guy not even
know what "self-made content" is?

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:02.083
He's only focused on training?

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.667
Let's take a break.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:06.708
That idol's self-made content...

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.625
it's for the fans.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.958
How about trying to
be a little nicer to him?

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.333
Yes, I understand.

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:17.042
Okay, so you know how I hit you twice?

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.417
This time, you subdue me.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:19.708
After you subdue me,

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:22.667
give me two uppercuts.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:23.458
Hit me hard.

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.125
Then, when you do the kick,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.375
please go a bit slower.

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:30.375
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.667
Please focus. The actor could get hurt.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.125
You look exhausted.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.375
What's wrong?

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.292
Do you want to take a break now?

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.042
What am I going to do with that guy?

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.083
Just air the fight scene from before.

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:48.809
We'll just have to deal with the backlash.

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:49.708
(If you don't want to do it, then don't)

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:50.417
(Totally fed up with the world)

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:51.708
(Stuntman VS Idol)

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.500
Ah! Stop hitting him!

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.505
(So cool how he doesn't
go easy on a celebrity)

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.250
Wow! It's a celebrity, a celebrity!

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.042
Don't be like that.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.000
You're pretty good at
stealing the spotlight.

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:02.917
Do-ha.

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.125
Don't make your instructor too famous.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.000
The CEO said he got an
offer for his own variety show.

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:10.958
People change once they get money.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:11.833
You know how it is.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.042
You're here.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.375
The instructor is later than the student.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.208
Is this what happens when you get famous?

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.583
Class doesn't start for another 20 minutes.

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:21.417
So you're not denying you're famous.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:23.917
Slower, ease up on the power.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:24.458
Good work.

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.958
Take ten.

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:30.333
Hello...

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:33.458
Hey, that thing you did...

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.833
that ja-con?

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.000
It's gone viral.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.000
So...

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.750
you got an offer for a variety show?

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.167
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:45.333
It's my first time, so
I was a bit surprised.

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.818
The appearance fee is really high.

00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:48.083
That's great.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:51.542
Director.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.167
I...

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:54.958
I'm not interested.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.750
It's not like I earned
this on my own merit.

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.167
I want to focus on my team.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:02.667
Hey, you...

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:06.208
Just take it.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.625
No.

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:09.542
I'm sorry.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.583
I'm an injured man...

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:13.167
Sorry.

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.268
I told you to take it! Do you
know how much money that is?

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.792
Director, your crutch.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.434
You think you're the only one who matters?

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:20.458
Are we just your backup?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.083
What's wrong with you? Stop it.

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:29.708
It's starting again.

00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.333
It seems like it's starting again.

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:33.309
Let's get a clearer shot of his face here.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:34.542
Let's adjust it.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.292
Then, like you said earlier,

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.708
let's add that move in.

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.875
Won't that show off the
facial expressions better?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.042
Senior.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:43.792
Moon Do-ha?

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:49.375
Is there training today?

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.333
I came to practice.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:52.792
At this hour?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.667
What's wrong? Why hasn't he gone home?

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:01.833
He doesn't want to go home?

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.417
Come with me for a second.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:24.083
What's this?

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:27.083
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:31.042
Training like that at
night will ruin your health.

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:35.322
You should try to get some
rest, even if it's just a nap.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:38.667
Lie down.

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:45.583
Do you think I came here to sleep?

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.417
I don't know much about the idol world,

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.875
so this might sound presumptuous,

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:55.375
but when you're troubled, you need to rest.

00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.000
I know perfectly well what I'm like.

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:06.833
Then you clean it up, Moon Do-ha.

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.833
You made this mess.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:10.583
What...?

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.583
You know you're talking nonsense, right?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.292
This is training.

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.292
Stay here for 30 minutes.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.750
This is workplace harassment, isn't it?

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.042
What am I supposed to do?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.833
What are you doing?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.750
My hand just slipped.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.792
Please, just finish what you were doing.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:43.167
Why did he even spread it all out?

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:50.333
Did Moon Do-ha leave?

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:54.958
Where is he?

00:08:58.583 --> 00:08:59.875
He's in special training.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.125
Hey.

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:27.500
Did you sleep well?

00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:29.167
Well...

00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:31.250
I was just resting my eyes.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.125
Want one, Moon Do-ha?

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.542
Huh?

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.333
I accidentally ordered the wrong thing.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:39.750
Why would I eat that?

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:43.042
That stuff is so greasy.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.917
I'm leaving.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:47.042
He must be hungry.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.458
Looks like he really left.

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:51.583
Who knows?

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.333
He might come back.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:54.292
No way!

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:56.476
You think that Moon Do-ha
would come back for something like this?

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.875
And run all the way back?

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:08.917
What?

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:10.167
What is it?

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:11.292
What?

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:12.917
We weren't talking.

00:10:15.042 --> 00:10:16.917
No, I was just thinking.

00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:18.792
If you ordered it by mistake,

00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:20.997
then the rest is just going
to be thrown out, right?

00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:22.434
Better to give it to someone
than to let it go to waste.

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:23.292
I could've eaten it.

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:26.250
Yeah, why order the wrong thing

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.042
and make things so awkward?

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.208
Now that you've eaten, let's burn it off.

00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:41.542
Moon Do-ha.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.125
Time for a run.

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:44.875
Doing okay?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.333
Again, again.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:47.583
How about it?

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:48.893
Feel like you've burned some of it off?

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:50.667
Who burns off calories like this?

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.625
But I thought you were weak.

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:55.417
You're a pretty good fighter.

00:11:00.917 --> 00:11:02.375
Ah, I'm hungry again.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.309
Use this and go buy
whatever you all want to eat.

00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:05.208
Awesome!

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:06.792
I'm heading out!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.125
Are you sure?

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.542
These kids can eat a lot.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.958
You're not worried
about my wallet, are you?

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:36.583
(Transferred 45,000 won to you)

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:37.917
Huh?

00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:39.917
What's this transfer?

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:41.602
It's for the money the kids just spent.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.875
Why are you sending me this?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.750
Did they spend a lot?

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:48.625
Do you think I can't even afford that?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.893
Can't I do something nice for you?

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.958
You're really hurting my pride here.

00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:53.250
Just you wait.

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.708
Let me take this chance to
show you some generosity.

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.125
There's really someone like this.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.833
Bro, did you see you're in the news?

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.417
It says a variety show wants you.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:07.822
Bro, are you going to be a star?

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:10.167
Hey, stuntmen don't become stars.

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:11.518
Instead of wasting your time here,

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.434
you should be getting
ready to be an influencer.

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:16.042
Move. I have a shoot
tomorrow and I'm busy.

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:19.792
Soo-hyun.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:21.750
Did you see my message?

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.792
No, I haven't seen it. What's up?

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:26.417
Moon Do-ha suddenly
asked me for your picture.

00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:28.583
My picture?

00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:29.875
What for?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.125
I don't know.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.667
Have they started filming?

00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:34.583
No, not yet.

00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:35.917
It's about to start.

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:38.000
Be careful of Actor Yoo Sang-cheol.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.125
You know how it is.

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:41.167
People get jealous of
those who make it big.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:44.208
Where are you scumbags?

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:46.667
Come on out!

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:53.917
You asshole!

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.875
You scumbag!

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.083
Cut! Okay.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.833
What do we do?

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.750
He's bleeding. Are you okay?

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:22.792
It's real blood. What do we do?

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:23.917
I'm fine.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.250
You were supposed to dodge that, you idiot.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:36.875
What's up?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.417
Bro, where are you?

00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:39.750
Are you in the van?

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:41.083
I'm on set.

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:43.458
Why? Is the director looking for me?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.083
Moon Do-ha is unbelievable.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:46.667
Hey, are you kidding me?

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:47.917
A food truck...

00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:49.625
Hey, you expect me to eat this garbage?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.292
Hey, what's with all the noise?

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.250
Bro, Jae-yeon.

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.292
Look at this. Isn't it amazing?

00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.101
I should take a picture to show
Park Soo-hyun and brag a little.

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:05.405
(Gu Jae-yeon, the Idol of the Stunt World)
(Save the filming set! [play on words])

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.250
Yes, this is Moon Do-ha.

00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.250
What is all this?

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:14.833
Did you see it?

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:15.792
You can spare me the thanks.

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:18.417
You think I'm grateful for this?

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:19.583
Then what?

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:21.458
What stuntman in the world

00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:24.542
hands out lunch boxes
with his face on them?

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.042
They don't usually do that?

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:28.125
Of course not. I'm not even the lead!

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.583
What's this?

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:32.125
Is this all Gu Jae-yeon amounts to?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.583
Take this seriously.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:35.167
You're my instructor, after all.

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:36.667
How does this reflect on me?

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:41.375
So, what does this have to do with me?

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:44.917
Look, even if you're not grateful,

00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:45.792
do you have to have this attitude?

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:48.500
I'll thank you when you do
something worthy of thanks.

00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:52.417
Bro, are we free?

00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:53.333
Yeah, what's up?

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:54.458
Where are you going?

00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:55.583
Hello?

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:57.792
Hello?

00:14:57.917 --> 00:14:59.833
Bro, Moon Do-ha is really something else.

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.101
Do you know how many he sent?

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:03.208
Moon Do-ha, the pop idol?

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:05.667
Guess he's got some clout after all.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.083
Bro, at this rate, are you really
going to become a celebrity?

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.625
Not just anyone can be a celebrity.

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:14.167
Gu Jae-yeon

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:16.708
"saved the filming set"!

00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:19.875
Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:22.667
Who's here?

00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:27.250
The actors were already in a bad mood,

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:28.917
and now all this?

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:35.375
But hey, the food is
good, so that's a plus.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.893
Is the taste what's important right now?

00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:37.750
"Saved the filming set"?

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:39.542
And it doesn't even taste good.

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:42.307
What are you saying?
When you're enjoying it while you complain.

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.458
Moon Do-ha.

00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:45.601
Aren't you busy, Moon Do-ha?

00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.750
My shoot is coming up, so I
thought I'd drop by and observe.

00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:49.875
Show me.

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:52.328
Let's see what my instructor
is capable of, shall we?

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.000
You scumbag.

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:05.125
Moon Do-ha, when you kick,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.625
you have to hit your
mark precisely. Precisely.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.333
If you get emotional,
someone's going to get hurt.

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:13.833
Moon Do-ha.

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.208
It's fine. Go ahead and kick.

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:24.375
You scumbag!

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.167
A scumbag like you.

00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:33.750
Cut! Okay.

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:35.875
See, Director? That's much better, right?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.208
Next scene.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.708
Let's get moving. We don't have time.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.875
What was that?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.458
He actually hit him.

00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:48.958
