00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.690
There was never any competition
between Xiang Man and me.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.320
Very well.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.670
The department will respect your decision.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.320
Still,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.780
I hope you'll take some time

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.010
to reconsider.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.080
Perhaps think it over
and let me know later.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.400
Alright.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.840
Lu Yizhen,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.720
you really have quite the charm,
don't you?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.780
Even the professor has fallen for it.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.240
It seems even a murder accusation

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.000
can't dim your allure.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.900
I am not a murderer.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.960
What murderer would ever admit

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.240
to being one?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.790
Oh,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.210
and just so you know—

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.840
Professor Fan's wife

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.640
also teaches at our university.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.300
You might want to watch your step.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.880
Let's start the meeting.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.080
Do we have the autopsy report yet?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.790
The deceased did have a history
of chronic heart disease.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.380
The cause of death
was a sudden cardiac arrest.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.020
However,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.250
whether her external injuries
were a contributing factor

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.150
still needs further examination.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.080
Understood. Good work—please expedite
the results as much as possible.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.910
Understood.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.440
Dong,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.550
brief us on the deceased's activities
the night of the incident

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.030
and her social connections.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.690
Sure thing.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.880
The deceased, Xiang Man,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.440
came from a well-off family—her father

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.080
owned a restaurant in the concession.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.550
But he had a gambling problem,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.870
lost everything,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.330
and racked up heavy debts.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.720
To escape his creditors,
he abandoned his wife and daughter

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.650
and left Shanghai without a trace.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.660
After that,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.930
she and her mother
only had each other to rely on.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.790
But when we visited their home,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.120
her mother was gone.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.370
Neighbors said

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.790
her mother had also gone into hiding
from debt collectors.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.320
What was she like at school?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.290
Xiang Man was a decent person.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.080
She used to be close

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.700
with Lu Yizhen,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.530
but after they fell out,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.130
she started spending time
with Wu Xiaoxiao.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:44.910
Oh,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.860
and she had a boyfriend

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.430
named

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.010
Zhang Zhiqiang,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.500
a foreman at Da Hua Dye Workshop.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.270
A foreman?

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.080
Yes.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.660
It appears

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.800
they met at the dye workshop.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.370
Alright.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.870
For now, our main focus is investigating

Zhang Zhiqiang.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.200
Yes, sir.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.140
What are you doing?

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.320
Didn't you say she was
no longer a suspect?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.720
Who said she was cleared?

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.540
While we look into Zhang Zhiqiang...

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.600
keep a close watch on Lu Yizhen as well.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.330
Understood.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.030
Is this Xiang Man's?

please have a look.

It's written on dyed fabric?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.570
Both good, yeah?

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.490
Yeah.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.850
One moment, I'll wrap this up for you.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.000
I'm sure your husband

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.750
will be very pleased

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.120
when he sees this watch.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.150
If what you're looking for isn't here,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.880
it'll be hard to find it
anywhere else in the city.

Miss, are you here to place an order?

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.230
No, I'm looking for them.

We just had a small disagreement.

be relevant to the case as evidence.

to restrict my freedom?

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.040
We suspect she worked here.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.310
Only our premier courtesans who have
private engagements outside the house

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.350
have this exclusive badge.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.680
Guests of Joy Pavilion also receive them.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.140
Mr. Du,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.750
with all these ladies around,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.820
are you still not enjoying yourself?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.150
I'm perfectly content,

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.030
but he isn't.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.670
This gentleman is quite interesting—

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.730
bringing a lady to our Joy Pavilion
for entertainment.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.970
Auntie San, see to him properly.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.450
Tell him whatever he wants to know.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.440
What can I do

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.270
for you both?

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.790
A friend of mine

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.480
had a cheongsam made
from the exact same fabric as yours.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.200
Oh, this is fabric custom-dyed
for our Joy Pavilion.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.130
It's exclusive.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.790
Do you remember a courtesan named Xiang

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.070
who worked here?

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.640
That college student?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.630
She hasn't been here for a while—

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.400
who knows,
maybe she climbed the social ladder

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.260
and became someone's concubine.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.870
Climbed the social ladder? As a concubine?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.930
That courtesan

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.960
had exceptionally high standards.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.350
She wouldn't just settle for anyone.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.940
[Joy Pavilion]

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.750
Bringing her along on an investigation—
isn't that against protocol?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.550
So what?

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.270
You really live up
to your reputation, Inspector Guan.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.720
But getting her to cooperate with you

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.070
won't be easy.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.160
Of course it's not easy.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.930
That's why you wait until she is

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.590
at her most vulnerable and desperate,
then take advantage of her.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.170
By throwing her a little kindness,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.890
she'll offer herself up completely.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.710
How did you become like this?

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.840
You could help me, you know.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.050
Do you really believe

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.350
your methods

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.790
can achieve your goals?

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.720
I need to give myself closure.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.520
What closure?

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.440
It's been so many years.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.120
Let yourself move on.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.880
You can stand there

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.070
and say that so lightly

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.560
because you've never been through
what I have.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.000
She's not a fool.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.360
She must have seen right through you
by now.

[Chongde University]

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.030
Good morning, Professor.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.550
Hello, everyone.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.310
Lu.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.540
Professor Fan.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.130
What a coincidence.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.360
I was just looking for you.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.690
You were looking for me?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080
Come to my office.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.350
Have you given it some more thought?

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.270
I haven't changed my mind, Professor.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.400
That's understandable.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.330
It's also a way of showing respect.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.080
It seems your relationship

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.890
was better than the rumors suggested.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.270
We...

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200
used to be close.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.160
I see.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.320
She had

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.640
a regular client.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.320
He seemed refined and scholarly,

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.510
but didn't carry himself
like a typical man of old wealth.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.480
Still,

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.240
he was very generous

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.230
and often requested
private engagements with her.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.510
Such a shame.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.460
Xiang Man was so young.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.510
She was such a bright student.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.350
A real pity.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.510
What was your relationship with Xiang Man?

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.880
The same as yours—

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.640
teacher and student.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.790
I saw the badge.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.590
You were her client at Joy Pavilion.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.270
You were her professor!

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.800
How could you do this to her!

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.110
calm down.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.000
I—

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.540
I only went there for entertainment.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.510
I never expected

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.040
to run into Xiang Man there.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.480
W-We kept things completely separate.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.310
What happened at Joy Pavilion

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.700
never affected our interactions
at the university.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.480
Did you cause the injuries on her body?

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.370
Injuries? What injuries?

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.310
I-I never…

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.200
No, I never laid a hand on her.

Please, don't spread this.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.960
The university would expel me,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.610
and my wife would never forgive me.
