DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:55.577
You'll need to share
a room with Ms. Go tonight.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.619
Will you be okay?

00:00:56.703 --> 00:01:00.206
Yes, I'll be fine.
We've been friends for over 20 years.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.250
That's why it's unsafe…

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.502
I mean, more uncomfortable.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.422
How about you come out later?

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.090
I'll get you another room.

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:12.844
-You don't have to do--
-I don't like it.

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.234
If somebody sees me leave,
they could get suspicious.

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.361
I have to go with it
even if it's uncomfortable.

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.114
Plus, Da-rim is already anxious
about getting caught as it is.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.911
Are you always such a perfectionist?

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.121
It's something I decided to see through.

00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:42.457
So I'm going to try my best.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:44.584
Let's head back.

00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:47.629
Mr. Kim.

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:53.635
In that case,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.511
I also want to try my best.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.643
Because I've just now decided

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:02.560
to see this through.

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.701
He's a warm person.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:21.621
He's warm-hearted and speaks warmly too.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:22.705
And his face

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.458
is just full of so much warmth.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.752
-His wife?
-Ms. Yu?

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.963
We're going to step out for a quick chat.
Let's go.

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:35.426
Here you are, Mr. Gong.

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:39.222
Oh, you must've also needed some fresh--

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.038
What are you doing?

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.084
Mr. Gong?

00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:15.550
Well, you see…

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:18.219
A flasher.

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.805
-Sorry?
-There was a flasher.

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:22.557
Oh, really?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.059
Let's spare our eyes and go that way.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:26.144
Sure, okay.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.353
Let's go.

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:28.646
Okay, okay.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:38.948
I like you, Mr. Kim.

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:40.783
Sorry?

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:42.076
I want to date you.

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:43.703
Oh.

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:47.123
-Well, I--
-You like someone else?

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:51.586
You've been looking at her all day
with such obvious eyes.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.005
Ms. Go Da-rim is the weird one
for not noticing.

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:59.635
But if you've been friends for that long
and still haven't asked her out yet,

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.347
doesn't that mean that's the extent
of your feelings for her?

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:05.808
It's that much harder

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:07.852
because we've known each other
for so long.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:12.190
I don't want to lose the person closest
and most precious to me.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.027
You can't ask her out
because you're afraid she'll reject you.

00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:18.404
Are you sure that's real love?

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:21.449
I don't think so.
There's nothing simpler than love.

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:25.036
I like you, I want to see you,
and I want you.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.953
That's it.

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:28.247
But I don't have those feelings for you.

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:29.916
It's okay.

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.043
If you don't,
I'll just make you have them.

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:34.045
You'd better prepare yourself.

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.986
The fresh air is sobering me up.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:03.699
Should we sit down somewhere for a bit?

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:05.701
Sorry?

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:08.663
Okay.

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.333
So what sort of drinking games
do young people play nowadays?

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.377
-Drinking games?
-I'm so curious.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.461
I don't play drinking games.

00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:18.589
I guess you're not young.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.856
Don't these falling petals

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:37.900
remind you of waves?

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:40.445
They're twinkling.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:42.405
They do.

00:05:44.157 --> 00:05:45.491
It reminds me of Jeju Island.

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:47.076
The sea back then

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:50.413
also twinkled like this.

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:53.499
You're right.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.543
It was so pretty.

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:01.757
By any chance,

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.719
do you remember what we talked about

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:07.471
back then?

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:10.975
But he's still someone I once loved.

00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:13.603
It's a bit disheartening.

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:15.646
You were mistaken.

00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:17.648
You mistook it for love.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.944
Does real love even exist to begin with?

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.988
I said

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:27.200
love was a mistaken belief.

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:28.826
It definitely exists.

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:31.078
It's just that

00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:36.042
there are people who fail to protect it
until the end.

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:37.543
And you said

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:41.130
love definitely exists,

00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.299
but it's just that…

00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:48.221
there are people who fail to protect it
until the end.

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.224
I did.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.352
But you know, even after thinking it over,

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:56.896
I still think I'm right.

00:06:58.648 --> 00:06:59.649
Why?

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:03.152
That way, if love ends,

00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:07.240
you can just think of it
as coming to your senses.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.161
If you believe you failed
to protect your love until the end…

00:07:16.374 --> 00:07:18.125
you end up blaming yourself.

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:26.926
So don't do such a stupid thing.

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:29.262
Sorry?

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:31.514
Who are you calling stupid?

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:34.433
No, I'm just saying.

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:37.228
What was that?

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:07.967
Hey, Seon-u.

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:10.052
I came out to get some fresh air.

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:11.887
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.015
Okay, bye.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.064
You can continue drinking inside.

00:08:22.148 --> 00:08:22.982
Go on inside.

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:24.108
Good night, everyone.

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:25.401
-You too.
-Good night.

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:29.488
Your hand is so cold, honey.

00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:31.866
-You should've asked me to come.
-Right, I should've.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.369
-Let's go together next time.
-Okay.

00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:38.497
Room 518. Give me the key.

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:39.874
I don't have it.

00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:40.875
You took it earlier.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.126
-I don't have it.
-Is it in here?

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:46.797
-Sorry.
-Seriously?

00:08:47.423 --> 00:08:48.507
-Come on.
-Okay.

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:50.134
Careful.

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:58.976
Hold on.

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:23.167
Seriously, what's going on?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.711
What's with you? You look like someone
who desperately needs the bathroom.

00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:28.130
Did Ha-yeong head to her room early?

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:30.883
I think so. She said she was tired.

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:39.433
Look at him taking care of his fiancée.

00:09:39.517 --> 00:09:40.559
I guess not.

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.243
I mean,

00:09:57.326 --> 00:10:01.497
a photographer
should have a far more discerning eye.

00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:17.471
Seon-u, you can wash up now.

00:10:18.764 --> 00:10:20.808
-Oh, okay.
-Go on.

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:26.772
Are you sick? What's that medicine for?

00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:28.566
It's stress-induced gastritis, apparently.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:31.193
I guess I'm not meant to be an actor.

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:36.824
You sure you're okay?

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:37.992
Of course.

00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:41.787
Get into bed and get some rest.

00:10:42.997 --> 00:10:45.416
What? I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.754
-Rock, paper--
-No need.

00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:52.590
We can just share the bed.
It's big enough.

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:54.133
What?

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:56.177
Why not?
We slept together all the time as kids.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.972
Hey, we're not kids anymore.

00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:03.309
What's with you?

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:05.311
Fine, forget it.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.981
Oh my, it's so nice and big.

00:11:10.024 --> 00:11:11.567
I'll enjoy this bed alone.

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:19.033
Was I okay today?

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.910
As your husband?

00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:26.123
You saw how everyone was green with envy.

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:27.625
Thanks.

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:29.710
It must've been tough acting all day.

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:33.797
-I wasn't acting.
-What?

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:37.843
I wasn't acting.

00:11:40.012 --> 00:11:41.680
I was just being myself.

00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:43.349
Then again,

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.727
you were so good to Jun's mom
when you were with her.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.612
Sorry, I just meant to say

00:11:56.695 --> 00:12:00.032
something along the lines
of you being excellent husband material.

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:03.035
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:08.707
What do you think of me

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:11.043
as a man and not as a husband?

00:12:11.126 --> 00:12:12.378
What?

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.800
What do you think of me

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:20.177
as a man?

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:38.862
No way.

00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:41.365
You have a crush on someone, don't you?
Who is it? Tell me right now.

00:12:41.448 --> 00:12:43.033
Don't tell me it's Ms. Yu!

00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:46.662
No, it's not like that.

00:12:46.745 --> 00:12:47.746
Why not?

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.915
I can totally see
how you'd be attracted to her.

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:52.835
-You should go for it!
-I said it's not like that.

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:55.879
What? Then why'd you ask that?

00:12:55.963 --> 00:12:58.007
Forget it. Go to sleep.

00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:01.552
Good night.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:42.569
But if you've been friends for that long
and still haven't asked her out yet,

00:14:42.653 --> 00:14:44.530
doesn't that mean that's the extent
of your feelings for her?

00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:50.035
Asking her out…

00:15:18.147 --> 00:15:19.815
-Are you tired?
-Yeah, I am.

00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:33.454
This is just crazy.

00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:36.874
They both must've lost their minds.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.709
He was on a business trip with his wife.

00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:43.255
This is insane.

00:15:44.798 --> 00:15:46.383
Should I tell her or not?

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:48.218
Come in.

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:54.433
What is it?

00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:56.226
I brought the expense report
for the business trip.

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.313
-You can leave it there.
-Okay.

00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:02.858
Wait, Ms. Go.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:04.860
Yes?

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:08.781
Does it look like I have something to say?

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:12.743
-Pardon?
-I mean, do I have

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:15.079
something to tell you?

00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:18.123
What are you trying to say?

00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:20.209
How about lunch together?

00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:22.711
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

00:16:23.212 --> 00:16:24.922
Did you know about it too?

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.882
Then again, how could you not?

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:28.550
News like that tends to spread quickly.

00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:30.052
You knew about it?

00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:34.139
Are you okay?

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:36.391
I just heard about it.

00:16:38.227 --> 00:16:40.020
The cafeteria is serving samgyetang
for lunch today.

00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:43.482
Should we head on over together?

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:46.777
What?

00:16:48.904 --> 00:16:52.282
My gosh, the chicken is so tender.
They cooked it so well.

00:16:53.742 --> 00:16:55.786
The soup is so rich.

00:16:56.453 --> 00:16:57.996
Do you not have any appetite, Jin-hui?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.582
Looking at this chicken

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:03.877
reminds me of the samgyetang place
I went to a few days ago.

00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:06.004
You see, I went to this samgyetang place
a while ago, and…

00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:12.136
Come here.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:16.348
You see, I went to this samgyetang place
a few days ago,

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:20.269
and I saw my best friend's husband

00:17:20.352 --> 00:17:26.150
pick the meat off the bone
to feed some ditzy young brat.

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:28.193
-So it's an affair.
-Yeah!

00:17:28.277 --> 00:17:31.196
They were all over each other,
kissing each other and stuff.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.115
It was a total mess.

00:17:33.198 --> 00:17:35.659
Then what about your friend?

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:38.495
Exactly. She's completely clueless.

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:41.707
She was going on about how he started
wearing cologne and nice clothes,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.042
and how it felt like
they were newlyweds again.

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:46.044
-But they were all signs of cheating.
-Oh no.

00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:48.005
-Right.
-Totally.

00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:49.756
So?

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.592
Did you tell your friend?

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.177
Sorry?

00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.305
No, not yet.

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:58.932
It's been weighing on my mind.

00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:01.560
I don't know if I should tell her
or just keep it to myself.

00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:03.645
Right. It's a concern.

00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:06.523
-It's a legit concern.
-Right.

00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:07.608
Of course, you have to tell her.

00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:09.193
Do you want your friend
to stay in the dark?

00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:10.319
Right.

00:18:10.402 --> 00:18:13.947
From my experience,
that's not always the way to go.

00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:16.116
It could just be a fling.
A moment of weakness, if you will.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.076
But if your friend finds out,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.120
then there's no turning back.

00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.123
Yeah, it'll leave a scar on her forever.

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.708
Just look the other way.

00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:26.668
-Maybe you're right.
-Yeah.

00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:36.220
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.186
Are you going somewhere?

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:48.273
I want to go on a walk for some fresh air.

00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:49.608
Then let me accompany you.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:51.860
You don't need to worry.

00:18:52.694 --> 00:18:55.072
I won't leave the hospital building.

00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:17.678
Look at you go. Are you tired?

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.429
Let's sit and take a break.

00:19:19.513 --> 00:19:20.639
Careful.

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:22.557
There you go.

00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:25.852
You didn't need to come.

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:28.772
How could I not?
I'd be worried sick if I didn't.

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:31.608
I'll gladly follow you
to the ends of the earth.

00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:35.946
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.991
Once you get better,
let's go travel abroad.

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:40.784
Oh no. What are they going to do?

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:43.245
-They're going to get caught.
-Oh no.

00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:45.163
They're going to fall.

00:19:45.247 --> 00:19:46.498
-Oh gosh.
-What are they going to do?

00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:49.418
They get me every time.

00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.295
Have some while you watch.

00:19:51.378 --> 00:19:52.921
-It's good.
-My daughter brought them.

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:55.007
I wish I had a daughter too.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.800
-Have some.
-It's good.

00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:01.763
They'll get into big trouble if they fall.

00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:03.181
Would you like one?

00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:08.979
No, thank you. I'm okay.

00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:11.857
SANDWICH BISCUIT

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.526
I didn't eat any of it.

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:18.905
My daughter ripped the packaging for me
because I was too weak after surgery.

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:22.117
Try it. It's soft and delicious.

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:25.662
-I said I'm okay.
-It's fine, take it.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:27.247
-No, really. I'm fine.
-Just eat…

00:20:33.211 --> 00:20:34.212
I'm sorry.

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:37.841
I was being too forceful.

00:20:39.885 --> 00:20:41.219
It's fine.

00:20:42.971 --> 00:20:44.473
Everyone

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:47.559
has their ups and downs in life.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.229
After my husband passed,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.150
there were many times
when I just wanted to end my life.

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:58.653
But I couldn't go through with it
when I thought about my kids.

00:20:59.654 --> 00:21:01.073
As a mom,

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:04.868
how could I hurt my kids like that?

00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:09.122
When I forced myself to keep going,
I found myself getting by somehow.

00:21:10.457 --> 00:21:12.084
What's your story…

00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:14.378
Oh gosh.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.965
I'm sorry,
I think I may have spoken out of line.

00:21:21.426 --> 00:21:22.260
Yes.

00:21:22.344 --> 00:21:24.096
You really did.

00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:28.100
I never said I wanted to hear your story.

00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:31.019
Oh dear.

00:21:32.104 --> 00:21:33.063
I just meant…

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.942
What's wrong with me?

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:56.586
I'm home.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.213
Oh, hey. You're here.

00:21:58.713 --> 00:21:59.589
What are you up to?

00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:02.676
I'm just choosing photos
for the ad concept.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:05.178
-How are they?
-Not bad. Take a look.

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:06.096
Okay.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.557
They look nice.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.724
-You think so?
-Yeah.

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:12.436
What's that?

00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:14.438
Oh, this?

00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:16.523
It's our reformulated baby lotion.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:18.525
Can you test it
and tell me what you think?

00:22:18.608 --> 00:22:20.402
It was a favor
from the product development team.

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.654
If Jun's sleeping right now,
try it tomorrow morning.

00:22:22.737 --> 00:22:23.655
Let me try it now.

00:22:24.489 --> 00:22:27.409
I share Jun's lotion,
so I'll be able to tell.

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:33.039
It goes on smoothly and feels hydrating.

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:35.375
Hold on. Let me see the ingredients.

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:37.961
It's the best one
out of all the ones I've used recently.

00:22:38.044 --> 00:22:40.005
Really? Okay.

00:22:40.088 --> 00:22:42.632
But why do you use Jun's lotion?
Don't you have your own?

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.719
That's just what happens
when you're raising a kid.

00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:48.471
You use whatever is left on your hand
after applying it on them.

00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:50.932
You have to hug them,
hold them, and play with them.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:53.518
If I use the wrong adult lotion,
it could irritate their skin.

00:22:53.602 --> 00:22:54.686
I see.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.105
Then what about the scent?

00:22:57.689 --> 00:22:58.982
Is it okay for adults to use?

00:22:59.065 --> 00:22:59.983
The scent?

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:04.112
It just smells like baby powder.

00:23:27.594 --> 00:23:29.471
The powdery note is strong.

00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:34.017
But as you said, if parents use
the same lotion as their kids,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.144
a scent that's too baby-like
might not be the best, no?

00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:38.647
-What?
-Right?

00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:41.608
Oh, right.

00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:43.985
Imagine if they were
regular office workers.

00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:45.946
Yeah, you're right.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:47.572
I guess it could feel a bit out of place

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:49.741
to smell like baby powder
at a business meeting.

00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:50.700
Yeah.

00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:54.162
For now, I should suggest
they make this unscented.

00:23:54.246 --> 00:23:55.455
That was really helpful.

00:23:55.538 --> 00:23:57.582
Thanks, friend. I'm off.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.043
Okay, sure.

00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:01.920
-Bye.
-Bye. Thank you.

00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:07.926
Kim Seon-u?

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:10.553
That no-name photographer?

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.390
I already told you he's a no!

00:24:13.473 --> 00:24:15.517
Come on, have some standards.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.726
Why did you even appoint someone

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.688
who couldn't secure a diploma in the US

00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:21.356
as the deputy director in the first place?

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:22.649
You take care of this.

00:24:23.233 --> 00:24:25.986
I wonder if David Kim
is done with his exhibition in New York.

00:24:27.821 --> 00:24:30.282
Ji-hyeok chose him, not me.

00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:33.285
What? Ji-hyeok did?

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.707
-Then just proceed as is for now.
-Honey!

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.125
I'll put my trust in Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:24:40.208 --> 00:24:43.962
Even Tae-yeong acknowledged that Ji-hyeok
had an undeniably discerning eye.

00:24:44.045 --> 00:24:47.173
Whenever he found a promising startup
worth investing in,

00:24:47.257 --> 00:24:50.552
Ji-hyeok had more often than not
already signed them.

00:24:51.511 --> 00:24:54.472
It means he has good instincts
and works fast.

00:24:54.556 --> 00:24:56.933
If our Tae-yeong approves of him,

00:24:57.017 --> 00:24:58.059
then I suppose I'll trust him.

00:24:58.143 --> 00:24:59.936
When he returns next week,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.564
we should have a meal
with Chairman Gong's family.

00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:04.065
We should.

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:09.529
Mr. Kang, can you confirm you received
the pictures I sent for the ad concept?

00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:10.947
Yes.

00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:12.490
Okay, I'll see you at the office later.

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:33.636
If parents use the same lotion
as their kids,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.930
a scent that's too baby-like
might not be the best, no?

00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:04.876
Mr. Kim!

00:26:08.713 --> 00:26:09.547
Hello.

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:14.094
Why are you all dressed up?
You're making my heart flutter.

00:26:16.596 --> 00:26:17.806
You smell good too.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.891
My makeup also looks good today.

00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:21.601
And I'm wearing a cute outfit.

00:26:24.187 --> 00:26:26.606
Should we take some first birthday photos
after the meeting?

00:26:26.689 --> 00:26:28.108
Might as well take some
since I look pretty.

00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:29.567
Well…

00:26:30.568 --> 00:26:33.822
-Today might be a bit--
-Forget it then.

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:35.990
I'll just spill the beans.

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:41.663
All right.

00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:43.665
Let's do it.

00:26:44.249 --> 00:26:45.166
Let's take some.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.084
Okay!

00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:54.300
Mr. Gong.

00:26:55.093 --> 00:26:55.969
Did you two…

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.304
come together?

00:26:59.013 --> 00:27:01.182
No, we met on the first floor.

00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:02.851
See you later.

00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:04.060
We should head inside.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.405
She was going on about how he started
wearing cologne and nice clothes,

00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:17.824
and how it felt like
they were newlyweds again.

00:27:17.907 --> 00:27:20.076
-But they were all signs of cheating.
-Oh no.

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:33.631
You sure about this?

00:27:34.299 --> 00:27:35.884
Your wife works here.

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.637
That's what makes it more fun.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.098
It makes it thrilling.

00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:45.560
Naughty boy.

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:15.340
What's wrong with you?

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:17.467
This is where I always sit.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:19.552
Find another seat.

00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:31.147
-Thank you.
-Here's the proposal.

00:28:32.106 --> 00:28:33.274
-Hold on.
-What?

00:28:35.944 --> 00:28:36.945
Look.

00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:39.405
Oh my. Nan-suk, look.

00:28:39.489 --> 00:28:43.827
-He's so sweet.
-They're always so lovey-dovey.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.412
-Thank you.
-He's just naturally sweet.

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.332
Goodness gracious.

00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:53.628
-Trash.
-Mr. Gong.

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:55.922
Mr. Gong?

00:28:56.422 --> 00:28:57.465
What?

00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:00.885
Could you tell us which concept
you prefer between the final two?

00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.512
Well, let's see.

00:29:04.138 --> 00:29:05.431
Let's ask the others first.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.351
Personally,

00:29:08.434 --> 00:29:10.395
I think the one on the right
would be better.

00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:13.189
If we want our consumers
to emotionally connect

00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:15.066
with the feeling of parental care,

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:18.862
I think it'd be better for the focus
to be on people rather than trees.

00:29:18.945 --> 00:29:23.074
But wouldn't that obscure the message
behind our environmental campaign launch?

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:27.287
You have a point. To make sure it doesn't,
we should show more of the trees.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.497
If we do go with option two,

00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:32.667
I think it'd be nice to have
a more front-facing shot of the kids.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.626
Why these two…

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.670
Hey, have you seriously lost your mind?

00:29:35.753 --> 00:29:38.840
-Yes.
-Maybe we should just make both posters.

00:29:40.174 --> 00:29:42.510
One focusing on trees,
and another on people.

00:29:42.594 --> 00:29:43.595
Okay.

00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:45.722
And the copy can also be different.

00:29:45.805 --> 00:29:47.724
You think so?
We don't need to make them the same?

00:29:47.807 --> 00:29:50.685
The format can be similar,
but I think the content can be different.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:52.520
I think that'd be good.

00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:54.439
And…

00:29:56.107 --> 00:29:57.233
Thank you.

00:29:57.317 --> 00:29:59.444
The poster with the focus on people
can be worked on by Ms. Jang and--

00:29:59.527 --> 00:30:00.528
-I'd like to do it.
-Okay.

00:30:00.612 --> 00:30:01.946
-Jin-hui.
-Yeah!

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.993
Then Ms. Bae and Ms. Lee can work on
the one that focuses on the trees.

00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:09.287
That concludes our meeting.
Let's go have lunch.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.290
Mr. Kim and Ms. Yu, why don't you join us?

00:30:13.374 --> 00:30:16.127
-Should I?
-Yeah, you should.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.378
I'm skipping because of my gastritis.

00:30:18.087 --> 00:30:19.881
-Are you still feeling sick?
-Yeah.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.175
Then why don't we go out
and have some porridge?

00:30:27.931 --> 00:30:30.975
Oh, right. I forgot I had something to do.

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:32.018
Sorry.

00:30:32.101 --> 00:30:34.020
It's fine. Work is more important.

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:34.938
Don't worry about me.

00:30:35.521 --> 00:30:36.356
Are they being serious?

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:39.150
-Let's head out together, Mr. Kim.
-Sure.

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:41.527
Ms. Yu, why don't you join me for lunch?

00:30:42.111 --> 00:30:43.780
I have something to discuss with you
regarding work.

00:30:43.863 --> 00:30:45.406
I'm sorry,
but I also have a prior engagement.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.158
-Let's go, Mr. Kim.
-I'm off.

00:30:47.241 --> 00:30:48.076
Okay, bye.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.410
Bye, Ms. Yu.

00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:12.642
Food that's good for the stomach.

00:31:14.602 --> 00:31:16.729
"Porridge or ginger tea."

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.567
LOVE PORRIDGE

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.695
What's this?

00:31:26.114 --> 00:31:26.948
Abalone porridge.

00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:29.158
I ordered beef porridge,
but they got my order wrong.

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:31.411
I'm allergic to abalones,

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.747
but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.

00:31:34.831 --> 00:31:35.665
Oh, I see.

00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:37.834
Then why don't you ask them
to make a new one?

00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:39.961
It's fine. You eat it.

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:53.725
How about we make it round?

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:54.976
I'll leave a note.

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:56.144
-Great.
-It could be bigger.

00:31:56.227 --> 00:31:57.687
-Have a drink, everyone.
-Yeah, I agree.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.731
-Oh, coffee.
-Coffee!

00:31:59.814 --> 00:32:01.941
Coffee after lunch!

00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:03.026
Ginger tea?

00:32:04.068 --> 00:32:05.361
Why'd you get ginger tea?

00:32:05.862 --> 00:32:07.655
They were half price
at the shop out front.

00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:09.490
Just the ginger tea.

00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:53.576
I saw you earlier today.
What brings you here?

00:32:54.786 --> 00:32:56.454
You seem to be in a great mood.

00:32:57.288 --> 00:33:00.083
Where did you go after the meeting?

00:33:02.752 --> 00:33:03.586
Ji-hyeok,

00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:05.671
I have a crush on someone.

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:09.175
I haven't had a chance
to tell my parents yet,

00:33:09.842 --> 00:33:11.427
-but our marriage--
-No.

00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:12.595
You can't.

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:14.305
What?

00:33:15.264 --> 00:33:16.390
He's a married…

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:18.976
He's a married man.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.770
He has a wife and a kid.

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:22.188
What?

00:33:22.814 --> 00:33:23.898
I saw you and Kim Seon-u…

00:33:25.566 --> 00:33:26.484
kissing.

00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:30.196
I passed off your selfish
and immature behavior up until now

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.739
as being cute.

00:33:31.823 --> 00:33:33.157
But this is just wrong.

00:33:33.241 --> 00:33:35.118
You've crossed way over the line.

00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:36.911
Are you saying you want to go through
with this marriage?

00:33:36.994 --> 00:33:39.705
You're the one who said
there would be no love between us.

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:40.706
So?

00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:43.835
Is this your way of protesting?
To prevent this marriage?

00:33:43.918 --> 00:33:45.294
Stop playing with fire.

00:33:46.045 --> 00:33:47.505
And stop trying to use people.

00:33:47.588 --> 00:33:49.090
I'm not playing with fire.

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:50.758
And I'm definitely not using him.

00:33:51.342 --> 00:33:53.344
Then what is it?

00:33:53.427 --> 00:33:54.804
The truth is, he's…

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:55.805
Could you

00:33:55.888 --> 00:33:58.850
keep this a secret?

00:33:58.933 --> 00:33:59.976
Please.

00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:05.523
I'm going through with this marriage,
no matter what.

00:34:06.107 --> 00:34:07.400
And once we're married,

00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:08.985
I won't tolerate infidelity.

00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:11.737
You should show respect
even if it's a loveless marriage.

00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:13.197
I mean, why?

00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:15.741
Why do you want to get married
all of a sudden?

00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:17.910
You only care about your own feelings,
don't you?

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:20.746
Don't you realize
you're destroying a family?

00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:22.999
Ms. Go

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:26.377
is just an ordinary woman and mother.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.378
If she finds out…

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:32.758
her world will crumble.

00:34:32.842 --> 00:34:36.053
No, it won't. This is driving me crazy.

00:34:38.848 --> 00:34:41.976
Why are you even worried about her?

00:34:46.147 --> 00:34:47.356
Because she's my team member.

00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:50.234
I trust you understood.

00:34:51.235 --> 00:34:52.236
I'm off.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.801
What's this?

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:17.178
Abalone porridge.

00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:18.554
-Have a drink, everyone.
-Yeah, I agree.

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:20.014
-Oh, coffee.
-Coffee!

00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:21.182
Ginger tea?

00:35:22.141 --> 00:35:23.517
They were half price
at the shop out front.

00:35:24.352 --> 00:35:25.311
Just the ginger tea.

00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:08.312
Come in.

00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.903
There's something

00:36:16.862 --> 00:36:19.573
I want to give you
before the presentation.

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:24.120
Here.

00:36:30.835 --> 00:36:31.836
This is…

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:34.046
It's the clover from last time.

00:36:40.845 --> 00:36:43.055
You picked it up and kept it?

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:45.182
It would've been a waste.
I worked hard to find it.

00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:48.269
Turns out, this is pretty effective.

00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:50.146
It brought this wonderful person
into my life

00:36:51.063 --> 00:36:53.024
who paid off my debt,

00:36:53.107 --> 00:36:55.735
bought me porridge, and more.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.531
I'm sure it'll bring you good luck
for your presentation as well.

00:37:00.614 --> 00:37:02.491
So take it with you and see what it does.

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:05.703
I have to say I do feel a bit guilty

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.955
for receiving so much support.

00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:10.833
I pursued this campaign

00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:14.295
with a bit of a personal motive.

00:37:17.798 --> 00:37:21.844
You want to carry on
your mother's work, right?

00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:25.056
"I want to protect my child."

00:37:25.973 --> 00:37:28.434
"I want him to live in a better world."

00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:34.607
I hope your mother's sentiment
is received well.

00:37:36.108 --> 00:37:38.652
Because that's a sentiment
shared by all parents.

00:37:46.118 --> 00:37:49.121
I just rambled on and on, didn't I?

00:37:49.205 --> 00:37:51.957
I'll leave you to get ready.

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:55.628
You got this.

00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:13.062
Hey, TF!

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:15.022
Wait, where are your shovels?

00:38:15.106 --> 00:38:17.483
You should've brought them with you.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.111
I heard you were just shoveling nonsense
to prepare for this campaign.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.405
Anyhow,

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:25.241
I look forward to your brilliant nonsense.

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:32.790
Do we actually have a shovel?
I'd love to bury him alive.

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:36.544
He just needs to wait and see
who laughs in the end.

00:38:37.336 --> 00:38:38.963
Okay, let's go win this thing.

00:38:46.137 --> 00:38:47.638
"Ten Pocket Kids."

00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:49.265
It means for one child,

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:51.308
as many as ten wallets open,
from parents and relatives

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:53.018
to even family friends.

00:38:53.644 --> 00:38:56.105
In other words, fewer kids
mean a more privileged upbringing.

00:38:56.689 --> 00:38:58.524
We incorporated this sentiment

00:38:58.607 --> 00:39:01.485
into our marketing strategy
to elevate Natural BeBe

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:03.279
into a global luxury brand.

00:39:03.362 --> 00:39:06.240
This is the "Born to Be Luxury" campaign.

00:39:07.032 --> 00:39:10.786
As you're aware, this is Jessica,
a Hollywood star and a global influencer

00:39:11.412 --> 00:39:13.497
with over 300 million followers worldwide.

00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:14.874
We proposed the idea

00:39:14.957 --> 00:39:17.418
of showcasing her parenting moments
on social media while using our products,

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.004
and we've made significant headway.

00:39:20.087 --> 00:39:21.589
How far along are you?

00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:23.632
We can sign the contract
and bring her on board

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:25.551
the second you approve the campaign.

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:37.188
MOTHER TF

00:39:39.148 --> 00:39:40.065
Luxury?

00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:41.025
It's nice.

00:39:42.234 --> 00:39:45.029
But is Natural BeBe
a company that sells luxury goods?

00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:47.615
No.

00:39:47.698 --> 00:39:48.866
Natural BeBe…

00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:53.370
is a company
that makes essential products.

00:39:54.497 --> 00:39:57.208
Products accessible
to anyone raising children.

00:39:57.917 --> 00:39:58.918
The essentials.

00:40:00.044 --> 00:40:03.547
Director Choi, how did it feel
when you first held your child?

00:40:03.631 --> 00:40:06.383
Did you wish for them
to make more money than others?

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:09.678
Or did you wish for them
to become a prodigy,

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:11.222
skilled in sports or studies?

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:13.265
No parent would wish for such things.

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:16.894
You just wish for your child
to grow up healthy.

00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:18.729
Don't you agree, sir?

00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:20.272
Yeah.

00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:21.273
That's right.

00:40:21.357 --> 00:40:24.818
For the simple wish
that their child grows up safe and sound,

00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:28.239
parents bear the heaviest burden
in the world,

00:40:28.822 --> 00:40:30.616
and they do so willingly.

00:40:31.408 --> 00:40:33.619
Natural BeBe shouldn't encourage parents

00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:36.539
to compare their children
and raise them to outshine others.

00:40:36.622 --> 00:40:38.791
Shouldn't we become their partners

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:42.336
who will share that heavy burden instead?

00:40:43.337 --> 00:40:45.839
Inspired by a desire
to stand by every parent out there,

00:40:46.799 --> 00:40:47.675
we make this proposal.

00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:49.301
This is

00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:52.513
the tree-planting CSR campaign,

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:55.516
"A Green Future We Draw Together."

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:59.436
How exactly does tree-planting fit in?

00:41:01.397 --> 00:41:03.691
On the left, you'll see the sapling

00:41:03.774 --> 00:41:06.902
that was planted 20 years ago
as part of Natural BeBe's CSR initiative.

00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:10.281
And on the right,
you'll see it in its current state.

00:41:10.948 --> 00:41:12.157
While I grew up,

00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:17.913
so did this tree to provide fresh,
clean air to this day.

00:41:18.497 --> 00:41:21.417
And it'll continue to do so
as I bring a child into this world

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.835
to grow up alongside it.

00:41:24.253 --> 00:41:25.629
Planting a tree

00:41:26.505 --> 00:41:29.133
means fostering healthy growth.

00:41:30.092 --> 00:41:31.385
And isn't that…

00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:34.972
what we do best?

00:41:47.526 --> 00:41:51.322
"In ten years, who will be taller?
You or the tree?"

00:41:52.072 --> 00:41:54.283
"It won't matter who wins,

00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:56.952
as long as you grow up
strong and healthy."

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:02.166
"Big or small,

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:03.792
yellow or red,

00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:05.336
I like trees for being trees,

00:42:05.419 --> 00:42:06.295
and I like you

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:08.088
for being you."

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:11.425
"It's important to be someone
without a dark shadow,

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:14.053
but I hope you grow up to be
someone who knows

00:42:14.136 --> 00:42:15.512
how precious a shade can be."

00:42:20.768 --> 00:42:23.103
"Watching you search
for a four-leaf clover

00:42:24.688 --> 00:42:28.776
is already my greatest fortune."

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:50.631
In hopes of a healthy world where all kids
can run and play without worry,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.719
Natural BeBe continues to foster a forest
that will grow with the kids.

00:42:55.803 --> 00:42:57.388
This is "A Green Future We Draw Together"

00:42:57.471 --> 00:42:58.597
by Natural Bebe.

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:28.043
Good work.

00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:35.426
You too.

00:43:51.024 --> 00:43:51.859
What are you doing?

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:57.448
Mr. Gong!

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.618
-We did it!
-We did it!

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:10.627
Good job, everyone!

00:44:11.128 --> 00:44:13.088
-Good job, everyone!
-Good job, everyone!

00:44:13.797 --> 00:44:15.007
Good job.

00:44:17.092 --> 00:44:18.385
You said you had gastritis.

00:44:18.886 --> 00:44:21.138
I need to have a drink on a day like this.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.557
I coated my stomach with medicine earlier.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.392
Then you should
at least eat something first.

00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:32.733
Okay.

00:44:33.525 --> 00:44:35.527
Mr. Gong.

00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:38.864
I totally fell for you today.

00:44:38.947 --> 00:44:40.657
You're such an excellent presenter.

00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:42.534
You were so eloquent.

00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:46.205
You know, if he tried to sell me
electric jade mats,

00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:47.748
I would have one in every room
in my house.

00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:48.665
Me too.

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:50.417
-I'd buy them all.
-I agree. You were amazing.

00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:54.713
That's why I've stayed by his side
for all these years.

00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:56.715
It's all thanks to your hard work.

00:44:57.299 --> 00:44:59.218
You should feel proud
of the fact that you beat

00:44:59.801 --> 00:45:01.887
our company's marketing team
with your skills alone.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:02.930
Let's clink our glasses.

00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:06.183
-I'm about to tear up.
-Me too.

00:45:06.266 --> 00:45:08.477
Come on now, everyone.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.103
Okay, what should we order next?

00:45:10.187 --> 00:45:12.147
Lobster? Pasta?

00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:13.899
Order anything and as much as you'd like.

00:45:13.982 --> 00:45:15.901
It'll be Mr. Gong's treat tonight.

00:45:15.984 --> 00:45:17.486
-Oh my, really?
-For real?

00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:19.154
Can I order enough for my breakfast?

00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:24.409
Excuse me,
what's the most expensive dish here?

00:45:24.493 --> 00:45:25.369
I'm curious too.

00:45:27.663 --> 00:45:29.540
-Amazing. They sell abalones here.
-Oh my.

00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:31.041
-Abalones?
-We have to order this.

00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:32.543
-One per table.
-Good call.

00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:33.460
That sounds so good.

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:42.886
Hold on.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.682
We should've invited Mr. Kim and Ms. Yu.

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.183
We all worked on it together.

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:49.309
They're both busy.

00:45:49.393 --> 00:45:51.270
They said they'd drop by
if they finish early.

00:45:51.353 --> 00:45:52.604
I wonder if they'll make it.

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.857
We should wait all night if we have to.

00:45:55.941 --> 00:45:56.817
We must.

00:46:00.696 --> 00:46:02.239
Mr. Kim! Over here.

00:46:04.241 --> 00:46:05.617
-Come over here.
-Sorry?

00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:06.743
Oh gosh.

00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:10.163
Ta-da!

00:46:10.247 --> 00:46:12.040
What's all this?

00:46:12.124 --> 00:46:14.251
-It's a party table for my first birthday.
-What?

00:46:18.755 --> 00:46:19.923
I'm ready.

00:46:21.049 --> 00:46:22.050
Here we go.

00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:24.845
Can you smile a little?

00:46:24.928 --> 00:46:25.971
Great.

00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:27.431
Can you take a bite of the food?

00:46:28.098 --> 00:46:30.350
Great. That looks good.

00:46:32.728 --> 00:46:35.105
Pardon me for a second.

00:46:57.419 --> 00:47:00.797
JI-HYEOK

00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:02.257
YU HA-YEONG

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:04.301
-Why aren't you drinking?
-Isn't it so good?

00:47:07.888 --> 00:47:09.890
What? Who finished this?

00:47:11.183 --> 00:47:12.559
This is amazing.

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:16.647
Who drinks wine like it's water?

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:17.856
You see,

00:47:17.939 --> 00:47:20.275
I'm in such a good mood.

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.194
I'm so happy right now.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.989
-Here's the abalone risotto and lasagna.
-Oh my!

00:47:26.073 --> 00:47:28.533
-That looks so good.
-Oh my goodness!

00:47:28.617 --> 00:47:30.160
-Thank you.
-I can't believe it.

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:31.244
Mr. Gong.

00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:34.498
Please have the first bite!

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.249
Why, thank you.

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:38.043
-Give me some too.
-Okay.

00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:46.301
Their abalone is really good.

00:47:48.261 --> 00:47:50.055
I'm allergic to abalones,

00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:52.391
but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.

00:47:56.687 --> 00:47:57.688
Oh, right.

00:47:57.771 --> 00:47:59.439
Jin-hui, what's the update on your friend?

00:47:59.523 --> 00:48:02.609
Did you tell her
about her husband cheating?

00:48:02.693 --> 00:48:04.111
I didn't even get a chance to.

00:48:04.194 --> 00:48:05.362
That bastard…

00:48:06.655 --> 00:48:08.490
I mean, her husband confessed.

00:48:08.573 --> 00:48:09.908
-Oh my.
-What?

00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:11.118
He came clean?

00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:12.202
That bastard told her,

00:48:12.285 --> 00:48:14.496
"I think I found the love of my life."

00:48:14.579 --> 00:48:17.124
He talked some bullshit
and told her he doesn't need

00:48:17.207 --> 00:48:18.917
money or custody, just a divorce.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.210
Does that even make sense, Nan-suk?

00:48:20.293 --> 00:48:22.003
That's a load of bull.
She can't divorce him.

00:48:22.087 --> 00:48:24.047
-Of course not.
-Right, it'll only benefit him.

00:48:24.715 --> 00:48:26.550
I think I'd let him go.

00:48:26.633 --> 00:48:27.634
What?

00:48:27.718 --> 00:48:29.010
It's one thing if I didn't know,

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:32.139
but I already know
that he doesn't love me anymore.

00:48:32.723 --> 00:48:34.349
How could we live under the same roof?

00:48:35.392 --> 00:48:37.811
I think that'd make me more pitiful.

00:48:49.698 --> 00:48:50.907
-SHOULD I COME PICK YOU UP?
-IT'S OKAY!

00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:52.492
ARE YOU STILL OUT?

00:48:57.664 --> 00:49:00.000
I think we took plenty.

00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:01.460
I'll edit the best cuts
and send them to you.

00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:04.546
Where are you going?

00:49:04.629 --> 00:49:06.965
I rented out the whole place
for the shoot.

00:49:07.507 --> 00:49:08.842
What about the first birthday ceremony?

00:49:08.925 --> 00:49:10.886
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:21.021
I'll see you at work.

00:49:21.104 --> 00:49:22.105
-Thank you for the meal.
-All right.

00:49:22.189 --> 00:49:23.523
-Hey, you'd better get home safe.
-Oh goodness.

00:49:23.607 --> 00:49:25.734
-Get home safely.
-All right. Wait.

00:49:25.817 --> 00:49:27.027
My goodness!

00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:29.321
I'll get going too.

00:49:29.404 --> 00:49:30.822
Thank you for dinner.

00:49:30.906 --> 00:49:31.948
Wait, Ms. Lee!

00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:33.784
-Let's share. We're going the same way.
-Oh, okay.

00:49:33.867 --> 00:49:34.993
We're off.

00:49:43.919 --> 00:49:44.795
What?

00:49:44.878 --> 00:49:47.339
Wait, where did everyone go?

00:49:47.422 --> 00:49:48.632
They all went home.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:49.925
Oh no.

00:49:50.008 --> 00:49:52.803
They have to eat this.

00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:54.304
Why'd you buy so much ice cream?

00:49:56.556 --> 00:49:59.100
You're drunk. You were drinking
like there was no tomorrow.

00:49:59.184 --> 00:50:01.812
No, I'm not drunk at all.

00:50:01.895 --> 00:50:03.355
I can even go for round two.

00:50:03.438 --> 00:50:04.272
See?

00:50:04.356 --> 00:50:06.817
I'm not the slightest bit drunk right now,

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.360
and I can prove it.

00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:13.532
One, two. Cha, cha, cha.

00:50:14.825 --> 00:50:18.245
One, two. Cha, cha, cha.

00:50:18.912 --> 00:50:20.413
One, two…

00:50:21.164 --> 00:50:23.416
You're the drunk one, Mr. Gong.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.377
We didn't even drink that much.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.379
You're such a lightweight.

00:50:27.462 --> 00:50:29.005
-Oh jeez.
-Careful.

00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:30.423
Careful.

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:34.261
I'll call Mr. Kim for you.

00:50:37.222 --> 00:50:38.431
The clover.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:46.106
I told you.

00:50:46.189 --> 00:50:48.066
It was effective, right?

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.944
Holding onto it

00:50:51.862 --> 00:50:53.780
helped you win.

00:50:57.242 --> 00:50:58.326
Yeah, if you say so.

00:51:03.123 --> 00:51:04.666
I think

00:51:04.749 --> 00:51:07.836
you're a really great person.

00:51:10.005 --> 00:51:12.674
You even lied for my sake.

00:51:12.757 --> 00:51:14.718
When did I do that?

00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:16.303
I know everything.

00:51:20.473 --> 00:51:23.852
-Don't tell me--
-How could I not notice? I'm not an idiot.

00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:25.312
Come on.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.649
You know everything?

00:51:31.026 --> 00:51:31.860
All of it?

00:51:31.943 --> 00:51:34.237
-Then do you know your husband is--
-Of course.

00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:35.989
I know everything.

00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:39.242
Abalone porridge.

00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:41.244
Ginger tea.

00:51:42.037 --> 00:51:44.205
You got all that for me.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.043
You even lied about
being allergic to abalone.

00:51:52.005 --> 00:51:55.008
Even earlier, you made sure to put
all the good food in front of me.

00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:57.427
You were worried I'd hurt my head
and covered the table corner.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.180
-But you pretended like it was nothing.
-Hold on.

00:52:00.263 --> 00:52:01.556
Seriously!

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.142
That was because I…

00:52:04.225 --> 00:52:05.644
I know.

00:52:06.728 --> 00:52:07.687
You're nice to me

00:52:09.522 --> 00:52:12.692
only because I'm a member of your team.

00:52:13.985 --> 00:52:15.362
But still…

00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:25.121
I find myself being swayed.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.834
You know…

00:52:32.003 --> 00:52:33.797
the nicer you are to me,

00:52:35.757 --> 00:52:37.968
the happier I am, but it's also hard.

00:52:41.513 --> 00:52:44.265
Because I know I don't deserve it.

00:52:47.143 --> 00:52:48.436
So…

00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:55.944
don't be nice to me.

00:52:58.947 --> 00:53:01.449
I'll also promise…

00:53:04.536 --> 00:53:06.496
not to be swayed after today.

00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:20.612
Chew your food thoroughly.

00:54:21.154 --> 00:54:22.030
Good.

00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:25.366
Sorry. I saw all the missed calls
from you last night.

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:27.243
I was too drunk to check my phone.

00:54:27.327 --> 00:54:28.161
It's fine.

00:54:30.914 --> 00:54:32.332
Here you go.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.669
Wow, dried pollack soup.

00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:40.048
Have some kimchi too, son.

00:54:42.509 --> 00:54:44.135
Man, that hits the spot.

00:54:44.803 --> 00:54:46.596
Who brought you home last night?

00:54:48.139 --> 00:54:49.182
Last night?

00:54:50.433 --> 00:54:51.893
I took a taxi home.

00:54:51.976 --> 00:54:54.145
I probably did.

00:54:54.229 --> 00:54:56.022
Yeah, I did.

00:54:56.856 --> 00:54:59.317
From now on, just call me
if you think you're going to drink a lot.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.401
Okay.

00:55:07.492 --> 00:55:08.993
-Jin-hui.
-Oh, thank you.

00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:10.578
This is the problem with wine.

00:55:10.662 --> 00:55:12.455
It feels like my head is swaying nonstop.

00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:14.624
Even my intestines are swaying.
I feel like I'm dying.

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:15.875
Are you okay, Da-rim?

00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:18.920
It also feels like I'm swaying…

00:55:20.338 --> 00:55:21.673
I find myself being swayed.

00:55:22.465 --> 00:55:23.591
Don't be nice to me.

00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:26.719
What was that?

00:55:28.012 --> 00:55:31.599
Ms. Jang, you'll be in charge of
recruiting people for the tree-planting.

00:55:31.683 --> 00:55:32.517
Okay.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.018
Ms. Bae and Ms. Lee,

00:55:34.102 --> 00:55:36.479
you'll secure the event venue and request
cooperation from public institutions.

00:55:37.147 --> 00:55:40.024
Ms. Go, you can prepare the press release.

00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:40.942
Got it.

00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:42.527
By the way, where's Mr. Gong?

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.362
He's in a meeting
with the CSR team leader.

00:55:44.445 --> 00:55:46.614
Considering the scale of the project,

00:55:46.698 --> 00:55:48.199
we'll need to collaborate with them.

00:55:48.283 --> 00:55:49.701
After always supporting other teams,

00:55:49.784 --> 00:55:51.995
we're finally at the receiving end
of support.

00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:54.372
That's the power
of being in a lead department.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.042
I guess winning that pitch
wasn't all good.

00:55:58.126 --> 00:56:00.753
In the end, we need to do everything
we said we'd do.

00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:02.755
I know, right?

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:04.507
I'm happy, but this is hard…

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.968
The nicer you are to me,

00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:08.803
the happier I am, but it's also hard.

00:56:08.887 --> 00:56:11.055
I'll also promise
not to be swayed after today.

00:56:15.602 --> 00:56:16.978
-What? What's wrong?
-What is it?

00:56:17.061 --> 00:56:18.104
-What?
-Is it a cockroach?

00:56:18.188 --> 00:56:19.314
-What?
-Where is it?

00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:22.859
Please excuse me.
I need to use the bathroom.

00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:24.652
Go ahead.

00:56:27.405 --> 00:56:28.781
Could it have been a dream?

00:56:30.617 --> 00:56:33.119
Wait, did I mess up?

00:56:40.084 --> 00:56:41.628
Excuse me, Mr. Gong.

00:56:43.546 --> 00:56:44.547
Yes?

00:56:44.631 --> 00:56:46.758
So…

00:56:48.968 --> 00:56:50.345
About last night…

00:56:51.846 --> 00:56:52.931
Did I…

00:56:53.598 --> 00:56:56.100
Did we…

00:56:57.936 --> 00:57:00.438
Should I ask this or not?

00:57:04.359 --> 00:57:06.277
Did you pay for my taxi fare?

00:57:06.861 --> 00:57:08.112
The taxi fare?

00:57:08.196 --> 00:57:11.950
Yes, I blacked out last night,
so I don't remember a thing.

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.370
I was wondering if you paid for it.

00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:17.664
You don't remember?

00:57:18.957 --> 00:57:19.791
None of it?

00:57:19.874 --> 00:57:21.918
No, I don't remember a single thing.

00:57:23.002 --> 00:57:24.420
I see.

00:57:26.464 --> 00:57:27.298
I'm sorry.

00:57:28.424 --> 00:57:29.801
I don't remember either.

00:57:30.969 --> 00:57:32.262
I also blacked out.

00:57:32.845 --> 00:57:35.682
You don't remember either?
Not a single thing?

00:57:36.683 --> 00:57:37.892
Nothing.

00:57:40.144 --> 00:57:43.022
I guess you're a lightweight too.

00:57:43.106 --> 00:57:45.525
You should cut down on drinking.

00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:47.569
All right, well, have a nice day.

00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:55.660
Don't be nice to me.

00:57:56.619 --> 00:57:59.956
I'll also promise
not to be swayed after today.

00:58:13.344 --> 00:58:17.015
YU TAE-YEONG

00:58:23.187 --> 00:58:24.022
Ms. Gong!

00:58:24.606 --> 00:58:25.440
Ms. Gong.

00:58:26.524 --> 00:58:30.612
I've acquired a hidden card
that'll completely overturn

00:58:30.695 --> 00:58:31.946
the results of the presentation.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:33.281
What hidden card?

00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:35.033
Please take a look.

00:58:35.742 --> 00:58:37.744
I'm busy enough as it is.

00:58:40.496 --> 00:58:42.665
What about it? Who is that?

00:58:42.749 --> 00:58:44.208
Take a closer look.

00:58:44.292 --> 00:58:46.628
This is Go Da-rim from the Mother TF Team,

00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:48.254
and that's Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:58:48.338 --> 00:58:51.049
A scandalous affair
between a married woman

00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:52.800
and the chairman's son.

00:58:53.676 --> 00:58:56.054
This should be more than enough

00:58:56.137 --> 00:58:58.097
to get rid of the Mother TF Team

00:58:58.181 --> 00:59:01.351
and even call off the marriage
with Taeyu C&T!

00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:03.311
Wait, but look at this.

00:59:03.394 --> 00:59:07.065
You can't really see their faces.
Are you sure it's them?

00:59:07.148 --> 00:59:08.232
Hold on.

00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:11.402
It has to be Go Da-rim.

00:59:11.486 --> 00:59:14.155
That's Go Da-rim and Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:59:14.238 --> 00:59:18.576
Anyhow, my team's youngest saw them
with their own eyes.

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:20.953
So?

00:59:21.037 --> 00:59:22.205
Should I release it?

00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:27.210
If we're going to release it,
we should do it properly.

00:59:29.045 --> 00:59:32.715
Keep an eye on these two
and collect more evidence,

00:59:33.758 --> 00:59:35.301
so they can't talk their way out of it.

00:59:36.678 --> 00:59:37.553
Concrete evidence.

00:59:38.137 --> 00:59:39.263
Understood.

00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:46.187
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.950
What are you up to?

01:00:00.243 --> 01:00:01.994
I'm writing up the draft
for the press release.

01:00:02.078 --> 01:00:03.329
I just want to work on it a bit more.

01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:05.623
Have a good night.

01:00:05.707 --> 01:00:07.667
How can it take so long to do this?

01:00:11.963 --> 01:00:15.258
This reads more like a list of slogans
than a press release.

01:00:16.718 --> 01:00:17.552
Does it?

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:19.804
Excuse me.

01:00:21.305 --> 01:00:22.765
Take a look at this online article.

01:00:23.266 --> 01:00:26.394
You can see the headline, lead, and body.

01:00:27.019 --> 01:00:27.854
Right?

01:00:28.813 --> 01:00:30.273
-The content includes
-Yes.

01:00:30.356 --> 01:00:33.985
-the who, what, and how.
-The who…

01:00:34.068 --> 01:00:35.027
The how.

01:00:36.404 --> 01:00:38.406
-And second,
-Yes.

01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:41.033
-try combining two or three key terms
-Okay.

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.536
from the lead
with some creative expressions.

01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:45.163
-Got it.
-Yes.

01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:49.500
There should be a file
of past press releases.

01:00:50.835 --> 01:00:51.753
Hold on.

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:53.212
Okay.

01:01:14.817 --> 01:01:17.028
Da-rim, are you feeling sick?

01:01:17.111 --> 01:01:18.154
No.

01:01:18.237 --> 01:01:20.031
Look at me.

01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:24.535
-Let's get you to a hospital.
-No, I'm really fine.

01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:26.370
Don't worry about me.

01:01:26.454 --> 01:01:27.997
I just need some medicine.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.165
Just listen to me!

01:01:29.707 --> 01:01:31.292
Why are you being stubborn
when you're in pain?

01:01:32.752 --> 01:01:35.046
I don't want to trouble you.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.466
I don't think I should do that anymore.

01:01:39.383 --> 01:01:40.343
Did you forget?

01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:43.930
All your organs are mine.

01:01:44.722 --> 01:01:45.932
I'm going to do

01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:47.767
whatever I want with them.

01:01:48.893 --> 01:01:49.811
So just do as I say.

01:02:14.168 --> 01:02:18.381
EMERGENCY ROOM

01:02:24.762 --> 01:02:27.098
It's stress-induced stomach cramps.

01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:29.517
It appears she's been
under a lot of stress recently.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.060
She should be fine soon,

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:32.812
and she can be discharged
when she wakes up.

01:02:32.895 --> 01:02:35.731
We'll see how she does on the prescription
and bring her in for a follow-up.

01:02:58.921 --> 01:02:59.797
Yeah.

01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:03.342
You're right.

01:03:05.928 --> 01:03:07.263
It's because you're my team member.

01:03:11.142 --> 01:03:12.602
There's no other reason.

01:03:16.022 --> 01:03:17.565
So don't let this sway you…

01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:22.486
or trouble you.

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.388
SEON-U

01:03:52.183 --> 01:03:53.392
But right now,

01:03:55.227 --> 01:03:56.604
I want to be the only one…

01:03:58.731 --> 01:04:00.024
to protect you.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.361
I want to be…

01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:06.822
the only one by your side.

01:04:14.956 --> 01:04:16.040
I think…

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:18.167
I've lost my mind.

01:04:40.982 --> 01:04:45.903
DYNAMITE KISS

01:05:16.017 --> 01:05:20.187
You didn't go home and stayed by my side?

01:05:20.271 --> 01:05:21.814
You're being looked out for.

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:23.024
And despite the distance,
the worry remains.

01:05:23.107 --> 01:05:24.734
It looks to me like you and Mr. Gong

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:27.486
are more than just a team leader
and a team member.

01:05:28.279 --> 01:05:29.196
Go Da-rim!

01:05:30.614 --> 01:05:32.533
What do you think you're doing?

01:05:35.286 --> 01:05:37.371
Can I get Mr. Gong's address?

01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:39.957
Does your husband know you're here?

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:43.127
I just thought it could maybe
provide some comfort and strength--

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.879
And people call that an affair.

01:05:44.962 --> 01:05:47.214
I'm not a good person.

01:05:47.798 --> 01:05:49.967
I'm also swayed.

01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:55.973
