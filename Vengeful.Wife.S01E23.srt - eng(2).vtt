00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.820
Master,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.820
this is so strange.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.259
Bai Cha's blood DNA

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:55.179
don't match her hair's.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.619
This makes no sense!

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.299
The testing agency is incompetent

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.380
to give such a conclusion.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.659
The DNA of Bai Cha's hair

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.500
should match

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:02.619
that of Lin Xia.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.740
No.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.180
The mystery deepens.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.180
Fascinating.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:10.819
I thought

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.780
they would match.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.140
Normally,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.459
should be mismatched, huh?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.859
They're two different people.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:17.060
So that means

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.260
Bai Cha isn't Bai Cha,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.379
and Bai Cha isn't Lin Xia.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.540
Then who is she?

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:24.239
Master,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.519
you're confusing me.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.900
What are you saying?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.420
Bai Cha must be Bai Cha.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.379
I thought Bai Cha was Lin Xia.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.739
Yet Lin Xia

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.340
isn't Bai Cha.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.340
Then who is she?

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.659
If Lin Xia was Bai Cha,

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:39.340
then who was Lin Xia?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.180
Master,

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.099
you're making my head spin.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.700
Seems only Cheng Nuo

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:44.739
can give us answers.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.959
What does he have to do with this?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.900
Because

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.939
he's a top plastic surgeon

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.140
who can change people's faces.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.500
Master,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.019
you mean

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.260
you thought

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.780
the current Bai Cha

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.540
is Lin Xia,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.819
so Bai Cha is Lin Xia,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.739
but the hair doesn't match the body,

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.620
so that person

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.459
isn't Lin Xia.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.099
Another possibility.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.759
What?

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.379
Bai Cha is Lin Xia,

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.099
while that body

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.259
simply had

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.039
Lin Xia's face.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:19.939
However,

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.259
the body's DNA

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.340
doesn't match

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.099
Bai Cha's.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.020
This means

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.979
that body

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.659
is neither Bai Cha

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.419
nor Lin Xia,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.439
but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.620
someone else.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:35.979
Cheng Nuo killed someone.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.080
Dong.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.139
Let go.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.099
No one listens to me.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.539
Mrs. Ye is so domineering,

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.780
controlling you at her age.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.020
Those who know

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.360
say you're filial.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.860
Those who don't

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.780
think you're a pushover.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.080
Dong...

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:09.939
Get lost!

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.419
Qin Yufei,

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.340
are you trying to help?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.580
I...

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.360
Wei,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.659
just do as I taught you.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.900
I'm sure

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.020
he will treat you well

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.719
and adore you.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.259
I will

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.180
obey you.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.860
I'll be filial to you from now on.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.860
Mom,

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.979
come out here!

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.360
Ye Dong,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.400
what's going on?

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.900
I forbid you from drinking.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.759
Why are you drunk?

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:51.900
With some drink,

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.539
you dare push me?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.580
I dare you!

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.419
Looking to die?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.800
Even defying me.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.860
You need proper discipline.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.019
Wei,

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.040
watch how I deal with him.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.139
Please

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.300
don't be angry.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.699
This isn't his fault.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.579
You should

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.100
blame that wretch in there.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.779
Put me down.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.379
Ye Dong.

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:47.100
Let go of me!

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.860
Ye Dong!

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.980
Ye Dong!

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.660
Let go!

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:33.579
Lin Xia?

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.000
The look in your eyes

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.620
reminded me of Lin Xia.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.720
(Has he seen through it?)

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:55.300
Are you crazy?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.939
Back then I chose Lin Xia

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:03.959
because she looked

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:05.939
exactly like you.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:09.459
But the truth is,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.319
I've always loved you.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.980
So what if you love me?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:19.899
We can't be together.

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:20.939
Why?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.980
Because

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.540
you're

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.920
not a complete person.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.220
Think carefully.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.860
Has your mother

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.319
got along with any of your girlfriends?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.819
Because

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.279
she won't allow you

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.540
to love any woman more than her.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.980
Go ask your dear mother.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:51.220
Why

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.180
can't you both get along?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.259
Why can't you both

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.139
love me together

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:06.660
peacefully?

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.139
Why don't you ask her?

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:14.639
Oh right,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.500
she

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:19.160
has prepared a special gift

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.300
for you.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.639
Ye Dong!

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.199
You ungrateful brat.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.139
Get out here right now.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.259
Go ahead.

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:33.220
Her

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:34.839
precious son.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:41.779
Wei,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.019
watch closely today

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.639
how I train your husband.

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:49.339
Ye Dong,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.100
kneel down!

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:53.139
Mom,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.379
you're going too far!

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.779
If you don't kneel,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.600
you won't have a mother anymore!

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.779
Mrs. Ye,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.300
I support your decision.

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:09.819
Cut all ties with him.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.220
Then he and I

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.040
can live happily together.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.139
Who do you think you are?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.939
How dare you speak here?

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:20.579
I'll rip your mouth open!

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:21.500
Oh!

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.019
You're so powerful.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:25.519
Well,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.620
I'll stop talking.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.060
Handle it your way.

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:34.620
Bai Cha,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.980
go upstairs.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.340
Ye Dong,

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.419
kneel down!

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.019
Wei,

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:03.259
see that?

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:04.980
In this household,

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:07.320
I'm the one in charge.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:15.779
Wei,

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:17.379
let me tell you.

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.059
If you want someone

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.399
to obey you,

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:22.179
you must make him

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.299
remember his place.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.279
Some boundaries

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.000
should never be crossed.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.580
Make sure

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.720
he never forgets it.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:31.519
Please

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:32.740
stop hitting him.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.000
It's painful to watch.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.419
Stop hitting him.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.419
Stop it.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.379
Ye Dong,

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:41.100
look over here.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.419
Make a better pose.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.539
And your expression.

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:50.379
Later I'll show you

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.860
low lively you are now

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:53.759
to let you

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.340
remember this lesson.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:04.460
Mrs. Ye,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.860
put more strength into it.
