[Episode 3]

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.150
I'm here to deliver something to you.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.960
What is it?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.420
Something from Xiang Man.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.690
Where is it?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.320
On the ground.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.470
In the bag.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.240
It's some drawings she painted for you.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.810
She wanted to go back to Suzhou with you.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.120
After she graduated,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.010
she'd become a teacher.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.860
You would open a dye workshop.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.610
You'd have 2 children.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.280
You'd also...

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
Stop talking!

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.930
Please stop.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.180
Don't move!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.970
-Let go of me!
-Are you okay?

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.770
-Behave yourself!
-Let go of me!

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.170
Zhang Zhiqiang.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.400
That watch

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.590
is something Xiang Man saved
for your dye workshop.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.920
She'd always worked hard for your future.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.190
Life was so unfair to her.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.980
It took almost everything from her.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.200
Yet she never gave up.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.120
At her most desperate moment,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.030
she met you.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.440
She saw you as her lifeline.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.410
Because she loved you,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.310
she didn't want you

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.310
to see her all scarred and broken.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.900
But what about you?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.630
What did you do for her?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.970
What did you do for your future?

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.700
You didn't have to love her.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.840
But why did you kill her?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.420
I love her!

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.680
That's why
I couldn't bear her being like that.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.680
I thought

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.700
she was just a simple,
kind college student.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.690
But I never expected

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.910
it was all fake.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.900
If I hadn't gone to deliver goods
to Joy Pavilion that day,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.270
I wouldn't have known this side of her.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.620
She was cheap.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.370
She was licentious!

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.800
She deceived me!

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.480
I couldn't accept her like that.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.450
But I love her.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.560
You don't love her!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.120
You don't deserve to love her!

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.720
Do you even know what love is?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.360
Dong.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.090
Take him to the patrol room.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.840
Move!

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.020
I'm sorry.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.770
I'll take you to the hospital.

[Shanghai Ren'ai Hospital]

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.270
Does it hurt here?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.900
Doctor.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.820
P-Please be gentle.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.360
Okay.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.560
What happened?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.670
Who did this?

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.840
Young man, hold her steady.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.370
I'm treating your girlfriend.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.430
Why did you scream?

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.680
Is it better now?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.420
Try moving it a bit.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.330
It still hurts a little,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.360
but it's much better.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.600
Relax.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.860
Your boyfriend

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.650
is even more timid than you.

You're fine now.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.560
Take her to get the medicine.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.620
Thank you, doctor.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.260
The doctor misunderstood our relationship,
but I haven't.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.140
Don't mind it.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.460
I've seen our photo together.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.110
Our photo together?

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.750
The first one.

The one in your wallet.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.630
That's your younger sister, right?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.720
The girl who was kidnapped

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.070
with me back then.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.950
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.760
I know you have amnesia.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.200
And so much has happened.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.980
I was worried it'd be too much for you.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.890
You're much more capable than I imagined.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.820
Your mental fortitude

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.120
and investigative reasoning skills
are very impressive.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.510
I really didn't expect

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.070
that frail little girl from back then

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.470
to become who you are now.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.000
Maybe it's because of interest.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.260
I quite enjoy writing detective novels.

As my suspect,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.130
how could I
not investigate your background?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.800
Then from your professional perspective,
tell me,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.530
is my writing a bit amateurish?

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.430
What?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.530
Seeking professional advice?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.070
Just asking. Answer if you want.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.040
But there is one thing
I'm really curious about.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.040
Why is it that at all the crime scenes

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.250
in your novels,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.270
there are no descriptions of blood?

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.850
Who says a crime scene must have blood?

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.480
No one.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.840
It's just common sense.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.760
My work is meant to break common sense.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.070
Interesting.

what he did to you?

Why did you hit him?

Just let it go.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.960
Let it go?

Yizhen, how can you be so naive?

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.350
Ask him if he's willing to let it go!

Do you know

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.909
who exactly exposed you

to the newspaper?

You were not worried

continue to stay in Shanghai?
