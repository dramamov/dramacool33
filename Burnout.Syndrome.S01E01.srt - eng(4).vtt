00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.030
Look at me.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.380
A bit to the left.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.020
Umm… Chin down slightly.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.860
Okay.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.979
Okay. Good.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.860
Take off your coat.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.060
Okay. Great.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.780
Follow me.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.500
Jira.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.220
Hmm?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.540
Did we get any good photos?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.020
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.900
Kai, you can go to the changing room.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.860
Thank you.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.740
Can you take a look at her makeup?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.620
Is this alright?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.620
I think the lips need changing.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.180
Excuse me, can you…

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.060
Add some more red to her lips?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.530
Mark this one.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.180
Not this one.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.700
Alright. Mark this.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.400
I think this one’s good.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170
Mr. Thames is gonna love this.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.730
Okay, nice.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.380
Keep going.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.000
Can I see the photos?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.260
Of course.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.970
Why are they all the same?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.460
What do you mean?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.580
Who chose these?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.260
We all helped.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.430
Is there any part that you want us
to adjust, Mr. Thames?

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.500
Can I talk to you outside for a minute?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.780
Jira.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.780
Hmm?

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.579
We’re taking a little break.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.940
Guys, we’re done for today.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.980
You’re free to go.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.780
It’s already finished.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.380
Thank you.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.100
-What happened?
-You can all go.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.540
Just a little bit of a problem.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.540
You don’t have to worry.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
You’ll hear from us if there’s any update.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.040
Oh, okay. Sure.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.220
It’s a shame, though.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.820
Sorry.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.940
Let’s wrap up.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.900
You can all go.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.670
I’ll give you the money
for your trouble later.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.500
How was it, Ing?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.230
Was he pissed?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.780
Yeah.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.800
Damn right he was.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.030
What did he say?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.100
Did he hate my photos?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.700
I told you I’m not really confident
with my photography skill.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.230
It’s not the photos…

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.270
He doesn’t like the concept.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.100
What?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700
I thought he greenlit this concept.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.860
I’m just as confused as you are.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.860
All he said was that…

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.600
This wouldn’t sell.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.900
Clients are like that sometimes.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.580
They see the final cut
and change their mind.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.180
What can we do?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.180
It’s their money.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.740
And Ji…

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.040
I don’t think you can put this
in your portfolio.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.530
You might have to put your
photography career on hold for a while.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.070
Are there any casting calls?

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.870
I’m in a pinch lately.

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:52.600
Casting calls…

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.710
There’s a commercial.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.100
You interested?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.970
I’ll do anything that pays.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.000
But they won’t pay until much later…

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.690
I don’t mind lending you
some money, though.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.600
I don’t think I can pay you back
any time soon

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.940
so you might as well find me work.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.780
Umm.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.800
I’ll go for one thousand.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.400
[PRICE: 1000 BAHT]

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.370
I’m taking such good care of you.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.850
Give me a flower that brings good luck.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.210
Every drop is fresh.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.530
Every cup is fun.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.800
Feel awake!

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.380
Cut.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.840
Let’s do it again.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.110
Can you make it a little more fun?

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.750
Take a breath.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.580
Okay. Stay calm.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.330
That last one was a little fake.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.150
Let’s do it again.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.170
Camera.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.650
Ready.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.430
Three, two, one.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.290
Action.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.750
Every drop is fresh.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.960
Every cup is bright.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.270
-Feel—
-It’s “every cup is fun.”

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.220
“Fun…”

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.750
Do it again.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.370
-“Every cup is fun.”
-Get it together.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.150
Three, two, one. Action.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.630
Every drop is fresh.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.000
Every cup is fun.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.700
…Feel awake!

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:36.600
Perfect.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:38.870
We’re done.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.890
What’s the matter?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.600
Are you crying?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.300
Hey…

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.000
It’s just a silly commercial.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.150
When people say it’s not easy…

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.850
I didn’t think
it was going to be this hard.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.070
It’s just a silly commercial.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.330
Don’t take it seriously.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.950
This isn’t about that.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.850
I’m just…

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.300
I’m freaking bad at everything.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.730
I can’t sell my drawings.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.500
I can’t get cast.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.070
Am I that much of a loser?

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.570
Not at all.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.370
You’re actually very talented.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.730
There are things you can do that I can’t.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.230
It’s all very normal.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.150
Is it?

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.740
You’re a passionate person.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.930
That’s not a bad thing, but I think…

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.960
You need to find yourself,
and focus on something you really like.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.770
I don’t know.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.000
Let’s not talk about work.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.380
I think you need to heal first.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.180
Healing needs money.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.550
I can’t even afford
to pay for electricity.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.100
I have 5000 with me right now.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.830
Take it.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.030
Can I borrow a little more?

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.940
Oh, you jerk.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.300
Did you squeeze those tears out just
to fool me into lending you some money?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.970
I am honestly sentimental.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.860
These tears aren’t fake.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.070
But I just need some money
to cover my credit card debt.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.380
Fine.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.700
How much do you need?

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.570
Three cards, plus interest…

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.170
I need 100K.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.500
Okay.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.770
I also need some money for this and that.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.970
Another 20K would suffice.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.190
So 120K in total?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.100
There’s also the electricity bill,
the water bill, and my rent.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.100
Let’s say 150K in total.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.300
The list keeps expanding, huh?

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.770
Fine. I’ll wire you the money.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.650
Thank you.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.350
Well, I have a request
in exchange for that.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.670
For 150K, I order you
to get yourself healed.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.900
There’s a place I know.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.400
It’s called Burnout Bar.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.410
Sounds like I’ll be in a worse place
if I go there.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.180
It’s a good place for people
who are burnt out.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.510
I went there and it worked.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.150
You’re a first-timer, I take it?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.770
What’s your name?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.070
Jira.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.370
I’m burnt out.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.170
My friend recommended this place.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.800
I’m Ben.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.940
I run this place.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.570
Would you like to order right now?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.050
Here.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.530
These are some weird names.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.570
In case our customers
don’t know what to order.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.770
They can just order what they feel.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.370
Then I found my drink.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.070
“Empty Pocket.”

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.880
“Even a heartbreak
isn’t as bad as being broke.”

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.870
Sounds like it would suit you.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.780
The drink may look pretty,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.300
but I’ll warn you it’s strong.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.460
Our rules are simple.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.160
Once you have your drink,
you’ll get a table number.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:16.900
Here.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.300
Once you’re at your table,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.100
I’ll randomly select another customer
to sit with you.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.550
You’ll get to talk to another
burnt out individual.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.500
It’s a two-way therapy
to share your sorrows.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.660
If you don’t know where to start,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.100
there are some conversation-opener
cards on the table.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.650
You can use them.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.400
I’m Pheem.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.950
What’s your name?

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.030
Jira.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.320
How old are you?

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.620
28.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.000
Oh, we’re the same age.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.070
Is this your first time here?

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.700
Yes, it is.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.630
I’m still kinda confused, actually.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:48.970
What about you?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.270
It’s my third time.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.270
“If you could go anywhere right now,
where would it be?”

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.740
I’d go to…

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.570
My friend’s gallery
in the old part of town.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.130
Most people just say Japan.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.300
It scares me just thinking about it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I’m kinda down and out lately.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.900
What about you?

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.530
Me?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.000
If we’re on a budget, then…

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:48.670
Oh, crap.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.100
You’re going to think I’m aggressive.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.700
Aggressive how?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.300
Do you want to go somewhere a
straight guy would, like a Muay Thai club?

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.150
No.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.800
If I’m being honest right now,

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.900
I want to go to…

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.349
A rage room.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.670
You know what that is?

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.900
What’s that?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.810
A rage room is a place you go to,

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.329
pay for a plan,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.349
and they’d give you some stuff.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.770
And then you smash everything.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:28.569
Smash.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.030
Smash.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.470
That’s it.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.330
It sounds…

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.070
Aggressive.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.300
I know it sounds bad,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.800
but I swear I’m actually a gentle person.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.800
But don’t we all get this urge to just…

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.940
Smash something?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.070
It’s cheaper than therapy, for one,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.170
and definitely better for your body
than alcohol.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.900
Well?

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.640
Do you think that’s a red flag?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.400
I find red flags… thrilling.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.850
You’re into bad boys, huh.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.600
Can you give me your hand?

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.380
Why?

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.800
I’ll read your palm.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:53.900
Here.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.100
Excuse me.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.950
I’m new to this so
I can’t read upside down.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.400
You sure you know how to read palms?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.700
I’ll have you know I’m superstitious.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.550
Of course I can.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.600
Show me, then.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.050
But before that, let me ask you one thing.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.470
What do you do for a living?

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.400
I…

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.770
I make art.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.140
I’m still trying to find myself, though.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.150
Nothing feels right right now.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.670
What about you?

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.780
Me?

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.070
I work in IT.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.580
Application development.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.170
Oh?

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.600
Does that mean you’re rich?

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.770
It pays well, right?

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.270
It’s almost perfect,

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.970
except I have a jerk-ass colleague.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.150
He isn’t all that open to my ideas.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.000
I’d say he’s against them, in fact.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.100
It seems like he’s always up for a fight.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.470
Why not just quit?

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.150
You hit right on the mark.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.060
Well…

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.000
He’s not just my colleague.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.900
He’s also my friend.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.300
We’ve built everything together.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.260
I can’t just leave.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.500
All I can do every day is pray

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.660
that he gets better.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.980
I believe you’ll get through it.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.440
Well?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.000
How is my palm?

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.250
Let me see.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.200
Thank you for the ride.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.700
Tell me how much I owe you.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.120
No need.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.580
You can pay me back
when you get a new job.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.300
I’ll walk you.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:45.980
Wow.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.450
You live here?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.700
It looks archaic.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.900
What’s your room number?

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.150
I know a little numerology, you know?

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.100
Now that’s weird.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.100
Too obvious?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.510
I thought I was being smooth.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.700
But am I allowed to know
what your room number is?

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.300
It’s 69.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.700
For real?

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.190
Now that’s a nice one.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.100
You silly.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.100
I live on the third floor,
the room on the left.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.700
Okay.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.500
Talk later.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.100
Are you done?

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.350
Can I see?

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.000
I still need to tidy up some details.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:47.880
It’s alright.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.750
We’ll take what you have now.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.800
Of course.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.750
Here.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.950
You’re quite detailed with your art.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.500
You’ve got good taste when it comes
to lines and colors.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.830
It needs to look more commercial, though.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.330
One issue is that you’re quite slow.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.800
Oh, I have one more question
since we’ve just updated our policy.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.250
Do you know how to use Generative AI?

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.370
AI?

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:23.980
I’m familiar with it.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.400
The position is a storyboard artist,

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.550
but with our new policy,
the workload also increases.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.800
If you can use AI to assist you,
it’ll save us a lot of time.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.900
From your taste,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.950
I do believe you’ll be able to choose
the perfect art for our work.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.250
If you want AI to do most of the work,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.030
what am I here to do?

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.130
You get to exercise your taste in art.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.550
Can I be straightforward?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.500
I want to work to prove myself.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.800
I chose this studio because of its craft.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.170
It’d be a shame to lose that.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.200
So do you know how to use AI or not?

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.970
From the bottom of my heart,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.700
I don’t want to.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.300
You write in your resume
that you’re adaptable.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.000
Is that not true?

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.470
You said you were adaptable.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:53.980
Yes?

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.860
You got the job.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.830
What?

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.980
What job?

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.100
I just got rejected from this job interview.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.890
It’s a dinner companion job.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.000
Dinner companion?

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.860
When did I agree to that?

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.660
Well, you certainly have
no right to say no.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.760
It pays well.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:10.000
How much?

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.540
It pays way more than a month’s worth
of storyboarding.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.200
I don’t want to be an escort.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.100
How else are you gonna feed yourself?

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.540
It’s tonight.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.580
The dress code is punk.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.850
The client wants you to be in character.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.770
I ordered some clothes on Hide for you
and should be at your place right now.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.490
Don’t let me down and get it done.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:34.780
Umm.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.070
Shit.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.080
The quality is shit.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.530
Hello, Mr. Don.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.030
Wow.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.270
Amazing.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.900
This exceeds my expectations.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.400
Sit down.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.700
I’m Jira.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:03.870
No, you’re not.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.900
You’re not Jira right now.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.500
I ordered this for you.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.100
Do you like it?

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.860
I…

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.700
I can’t eat raw meat.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.100
But you love this dish.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.780
I’m sorry.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.640
I really can’t eat it.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.000
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you in advance.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.800
Do you understand what I’m saying?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.730
You must like this dish.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.900
You can eat it.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.140
Eat it.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:18.900
Eat.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.110
Hey.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.580
Can you at least look happy?

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.970
The one I hired before this
wasn’t half as picky as you are.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.660
If you like him, why don’t you
go and hire him again?

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.830
How can you say that?

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.000
I paid for you.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.780
You do as I say.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.200
But I told you I can’t eat it.
Just tell me to do something else.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.510
I’ll give you some advice.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.000
If you can’t live up to the role,
don’t take the job in the first place.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:09.580
You’re incompetent.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.400
I thought you said you were adaptable.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.000
You said you were adaptable.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.220
Is that not true?

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.380
You like punk, don’t you?

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.730
Get the hell away from my face!

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.940
If you don’t,
I’ll freaking keep screaming!

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.400
-Go away!
-Are you insane?

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.300
-Get out of my face!
-You brat!

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.350
This is for you.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.050
I don’t want to eat.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.180
That guy ordered for you.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:09.800
What the hell now?

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.870
What the hell do you want from me?!

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.400
Answer me!

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.600
It’s nothing.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.000
I just want to take care of you.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.300
You’re interesting.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.170
That’s some bullshit!

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.750
It’s not.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.770
Is this how you dress every day?

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.200
Do you always scream?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.930
I was hired for it so I have to do it.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.580
What the hell do you want?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.370
Take a seat.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.770
Is there someone who’s freaking
normal around here?

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.100
Here.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.300
Drink.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.330
What’s your name?

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.750
Jira.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.550
Are you a full-time escort or
do you do something else, too?

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.300
Am I in a job interview?

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.100
Yes.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.300
If I like your answers,
you’ll get the job.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.450
I can do everything.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.500
Drawing.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.500
Acting, photography, and styling.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.400
You famous?

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.100
What do you mean by acting?

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.000
Well, musicals and commercials.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.500
So what exactly do you want to do?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.650
Listen up.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.500
In this day and age, I’ll do whatever
I’m told to do if I get paid.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.950
If I want you to be someone
in order to do something,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.780
will you do it?

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.530
As long as the instruction’s
not too shitty,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.900
I’ll get it done.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.450
Stare at me for 10 seconds.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.470
How does that feel?

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:29.980
Well…

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.300
Kinda nervous.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.570
That’s alright.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.590
Practice will make perfect.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.200
But that was good.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.750
You’re alright.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.240
What does that mean?

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.100
I don’t feel a thing for you.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:49.570
What?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.550
I don’t think this place is safe.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.600
If you want to know more
about this job offer,

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.250
come back to the hotel with me.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.900
How much do you pay?

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.700
You sure that’s not
an extra zero at the end?

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.980
I stand correct.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.180
This has gotta be some bullshit.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.600
I don’t even know if you have that money.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.130
Just make up your mind.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.800
I’m leaving.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.900
Go ahead.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:41.670
Well?

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.230
How is my palm?

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.850
Your palm says

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.850
you’re going to get a new job soon.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.180
But…

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.500
It’s going to be hard-earned,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.180
and likely to bring a lot of mishaps.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.500
But you have nothing to worry about.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.070
Everything will turn out just fine

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:23.699
as long as you trust your feelings.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.050
Hey.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.260
Hey.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.969
Hey.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.570
I’ll take it.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.100
Can I just ask you this?

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.760
What is it that I have to do
that we have to talk in a hotel?

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:41.900
What do you think you have to do?

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.889
Do you do this often?

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.300
What do you mean?

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.380
Bringing someone you like home.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.100
I don’t often find someone I like.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:54.400
Get in the car.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.450
You booked the place in advance for this?

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.100
I live here.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.020
What?

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.830
The rent must be astronomical.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.950
Hey.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.030
Don’t you have a maid?

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.500
I don’t like having people in my space

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.400
unless it is necessary.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.980
Is it necessary to bring me here, then?

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.730
You’re good-looking,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.580
but put your clothes back on
and come sit over here.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.620
You have really distinct eyebags.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:10.510
Don’t you sleep?

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.380
I have insomnia.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.670
With all this money and
there’s something keeping you up?

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.380
Let’s not talk about me.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.540
What did you study?

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.260
Visual Communication.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.930
Do you have a lot of friends at work?

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.770
What’s your social media presence?

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:09.900
Hey.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.500
Are you planning to murder me?

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.060
I texted my friend
that I’m with you, though.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.000
Don’t be ridiculous.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.530
“When will I get to have a say
in my own life?”

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.700
“Make my own decisions.
Hate my own decisions.”

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.500
“Make my own mistakes.”

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:34.900
Who is this about?

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.300
Just forget it.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.700
It’s just someone I worked for.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.740
Who?

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.350
Which company?

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.120
I was working on the catalog
of some company called Library.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:46.860
I see.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:47.980
Thames?

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.380
You know him?

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.180
Since you asked me all these questions,

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.570
let me ask you something, too.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:05.980
What’s your name?

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.260
What do you do for a living?

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.090
What am I here for?

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:18.350
Hey.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.240
Answer me at least one of the questions.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.700
My name is Koh.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.100
Alright?

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.300
You got the job.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.420
Leave me your contact.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.450
I’ll get in touch when I need you to work.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.860
What about today?

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.840
You can go.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.200
Your heart line is very prominent.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.900
If you let your emotions lead the way,

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.780
it’d be good for you.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.700
What exactly am I here to do?

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.370
I want you to be Mr. K.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.000
Just look through his stuff.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.690
There’s gotta be something
that tells you who he is.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.260
Do you need to take away
my phone and bag?

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.940
We haven’t signed a contract.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.530
I need to be careful, don’t I?

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.960
Our company is restructuring.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.540
There’s no need for pretty words
when you just want to fire people.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.220
I didn’t expect an IT guy like you

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.820
to have a tattoo like that.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.050
You like it?
