[Maintain Law and Discipline]

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.890
These are my findings in the hospital.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.800
I've also verified the facts
with Mei from the nursing home.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.490
Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.910
did embezzle all the charitable funds
meant for the nursing home.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.240
Even the donations specifically

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.380
directed to each elderly resident

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.640
were taken away by them

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.430
through intimidation, fraud,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.560
and even threats of violence.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590
This is known to all in the nursing home.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.800
Angry though people are,
they keep silent out of fear.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
What's your opinion?

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.910
After compiling the information
from various sources,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.190
I made the following deductions.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.030
The deceased,
Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.740
were well acquainted with each other
as friends.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.240
They went to a casino together

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.430
in the hope of making a fortune
by cheating.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.660
Unexpectedly, they were caught in the act.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.020
Then, Long turned his back on them.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.560
Liu and Zhou ended up owing massive debts.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.690
To pay off the debts,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.430
they started

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.030
targeting the nursing home.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.190
Liu Jialiang even confined his own mother

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.140
in an attempt to extort more money.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.840
Therefore, we have grounds for suspicion

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.380
that the killer of Liu and Zhou

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.380
is connected with the nursing home.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.680
That doesn't sound right.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.280
Most of those in the nursing home
are elderly people

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.520
who can barely walk steadily.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.870
How could any of them have possibly
committed two murders in a row?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630
I know it sounds unbelievable.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.510
Nut based on the evidence
found at the scenes

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.630
and the information we have,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.290
this is a strong possibility.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.560
First,
they had sufficient motive for murder.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.190
Second,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.710
we found large amounts

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930
of sedatives in the victims' bodies,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240
which means the killer took their lives

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.400
when they were incapacitated.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.560
Under those circumstances,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.420
anyone could carry out a killing.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
So, the killer could be

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.070
a staffer in the nursing home.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.630
Correct.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.520
Take Mei as an example.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.360
She knows the dark secrets
about the nursing home,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.280
and she suffered for a long time

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.590
under the oppression of Liu and Zhou.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.450
Even people like Mei
can't be ruled out as suspects.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.150
I agree with her.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.780

was a typist at Huating Trading Company.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.300
Her body was discovered
by the restaurant chef's apprentice,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.830
as he opened the door.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.660

had a banquet scheduled

to the kitchen been inquired?

Yes.

as the previous two victims.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.920

by the same person?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.870
Understood?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.630
Understood.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.330
Get to work.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.420
Take a nap if you're tired.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.400
Newcomers to the Police Station

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.290
usually find it hard to settle in.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.490
I'm actually...

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.910
I'm actually adjusting well.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.790
I can manage.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Look into this.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.450
Okay. Just a moment.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.580
Lu Yizhen, pull yourself together.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.020
Dong.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.840
Do you have anything

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.670
that can refresh my mind?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.540
Something refreshing...

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.800
A cup of coffee.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.950
I've had cups of coffee.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.480
I can't drink that anymore.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.840
Why not go home and get some sleep?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.570
This is going to be a long night.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.990
How are you still so energetic?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.710
Me?

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.870
After working for many years
in the police station,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.800
I've got used to this work pattern.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.680
You're new here.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.510
It's understandable
that you haven't adjusted to it.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.370
Just take a nap.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.780
Maybe I should resort to drastic measures.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.690
I forgot a document.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.810
Get some sleep. It won't affect anything.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.960
Inspector,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.870
why not just let her go?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.750
It'll take her several hours on the road
if she leaves now.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.950
All that time will be wasted traveling.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.730
That's true.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.080
Besides, she said she could adjust

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.680
and continue reading files.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.090
Go ahead with your work.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.150
Be gentle.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.200
Hello?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.890
This is the Police Station.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.390
You're asking for Lu Yizhen?

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.450
Okay, please hold.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.390
Lu Yizhen.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.840
Lu Yizhen!

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.530
A call for you.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.390
Thanks.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.400
Hello, this is Lu Yizhen.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.600
Mrs. Gao?

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.130
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.370
What happened?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.660
It was a call from Fang Ruhai.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.750
He said Mrs. Gao was at his place.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.600
But she got sick,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.720
and he couldn't send her back,
so he asked me to come over.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.980
Any doubts about that?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.390
Fang works for the China International
Famine Relief Commission.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.360
This institute

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.440
has rendered help
to the nursing home before.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.200
He could've asked

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.630
a colleague of his to send Mrs. Gao back.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.430
Why did he call me in particular?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.630
I'll go with you.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.270
No need.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.160
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.550
Dong,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.790
in our files, is there information

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.600
about the China International
Famine Relief Commission?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.530
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.140
I'm looking for it.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.650
Alright.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.740
I'm leaving now.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.160
It's a chance to investigate Fang Ruhai.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.640
Dong,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.150
go with Lu Yizhen.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.210
I'll do the search.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.600
Hurry up.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.130
Okay, fine.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.600
I thought

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.470
Officer Lu would come alone.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.270
With the two of us here,

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.530
Mrs. Gao's safety can be better secured.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.570
Where is she?

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.510
Come on in.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.480
Why is it so cold

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.790
inside your house?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.850
My mother is sensitive to heat.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.850
So, I usually prepare large ice pieces
to cool the air

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.420
for her.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.200
Have some water.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.400
Thank you very much.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.750
Thank you.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.470
I was just getting a bit thirsty.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.520
Your place is really hard to find.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.270
Where's Mrs. Gao?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.320
She's in her room.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.510
I'll go get her for you.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.910
Okay.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.960
Have some water.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.750
Thank you. Don't be so formal.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.740
I need to report an emergency.
I need to...

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.150
How may I help you?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.240
I need to report an emergency.
I need to see the inspector.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.630
The inspector...

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.630
Ma'am, calm down.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.720
Just tell me what happened.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840
I need to see the inspector. I need to...

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.170
I am the inspector here.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.100
What emergency are you reporting?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.030
Inspector, Meijuan asked me to come here.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.550
Meijuan is in danger.
Meijuan is in danger.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.290
Ma'am.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.750
Are you Mrs. Gao from the nursing home?

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.960
You know who I am?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.600
Shouldn't you be at Fang Ruhai's place?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.510
No, no. Meijuan is in danger!

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.000
Meijuan is in danger...

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.790
Who is Meijuan? What danger is she in?

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.120
Here.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.320
Here you are, Inspector.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.390
M-Meijuan asked me to give you this.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.120
I'll read it.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.150
Alright.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.360
Take a seat. I'll read the note.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.860
Meijuan is in danger.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.910
Calm down. No rush.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.320
Meijuan is in danger.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.050
Take it easy.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.510
Meijuan...

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.440
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.080
-Sit down please.
-Calm down.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.280

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.590
Meijuan is in danger.

Meijuan is in danger.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.480
It's okay. We're here to help.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.870
Meijuan... Meijuan is in danger.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.670
Calm down. Put your mind at ease.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.510
Liu, Yuan, Le!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.240
Look after her. Let's go!

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.100

You're a real jerk!

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.720
Yes.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.510
I am a jerk.

I saw everything.

You pushed your own mother to the ground.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.240
Since you're unfilial,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.150
I should punish you
in your mother's stead!

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.120
Consider it an order.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.940
I'll wait for you outside.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.160
Rest assured.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.750
Let's have a brief chat.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.350
Judging from your condition,

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.740
I assume you still have a clear mind,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.740
since you remember firing your gun.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400
Dr. Gu, I...

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.260
When I was in Fang Ruhai's house,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.190
I drank some water with drugs in it.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.270
So, at that time, I might not have been

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.270
of sound mind...

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.070
I understand.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.160
Inspector Guan already told me

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.360
what happened there.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.280
How is Fang Ruhai?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.440
He's in emergency surgery.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.060
It's still unclear
whether he'll make it or not,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.260
since he was shot in the femoral artery.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.750
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.210
Do you regret it?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.000
No.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.450
I had no other option back then.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.680
You believe...

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.350
you would've died

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.370
if you hadn't shot him at that time?

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.640
Yes.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.410
But still, I didn't want him dead.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.550
I understand.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.760
Very good.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.070
You're feeling guilt, remorse,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.880
even fear, and a sense of dread.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.930
This is completely normal.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.110
Your counterattack

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.200
was an instinctive response to stress.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.030
Though officers such as yourself
have received professional training,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.880
and are more mentally resilient
than ordinary people,

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.590
the human will to live
can be stronger than you think,

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.590
especially in extreme situations.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.890
It's fine to have those emotions,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.450
but don't beat yourself up.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.200
The will to live...

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.960
Perhaps it's related
to what I've been through.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.480
I know.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.000
I read your profile beforehand

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.590
and learned a bit about your past.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.920
Don't hastily draw conclusions

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.400
on uncertain matters.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.270
But this is not

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.930
a subject of today's session.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.250
Regarding the shooting incident only...

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.590
would you feel better
if I said the following?

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.320
Here it goes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.130
Whether you had shot Fang Ruhai or not,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200
he wouldn't have lived much longer.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.040
What do you mean?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.840
Fang Ruhai was diagnosed

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.720
with a terminal illness a year ago.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.920
He would probably...

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.320
only have a few more weeks to live.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.300
It's okay. Relax. All is fine.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.750
Take a break.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.690
Eat an apple.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.750
Dr. Gu,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.900
don't you have other questions for me?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.270
No.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.200
Is the therapy over?

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.200
Yes.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.640
For you,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.570
this conversation was just a formality.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.900
You'll be fine.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.330
Trust yourself.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:02.790
[Office]

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.800
How are you?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.480
I'm quite well.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.080
You didn't have to wait here.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.240
I just came to tell you

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.010
the case is closed.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.160
You can return to your post
when you're discharged from the hospital.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.960
What's the deal with Fang Ruhai?

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.350
Actually, he started killing

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.060
as he became worried that after he died,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.060
no one would take care of his mother.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.500
Fang Ruhai's wife passed away early.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.030
They didn't have children.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.440
Fang is a rather rigid man

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.880
without any close friends.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.270
The only solution

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.400
he could come up with

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.590
was to kill his own mother first

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.120
before taking his own life.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.200
That way,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.960
his mother wouldn't suffer for a lack of

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.690
caregivers.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.300
Fang Ruhai’s mother

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.500
noticed something odd with her son

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.160
and wrote a letter to her good friend,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.880
namely Mrs. Gao in the nursing home.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.830
Unfortunately, Mrs. Gao has dementia.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.750
Although she received the letter,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.110
she forgot all the content,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.570
except that she had to go see
her good friend.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.920
But it was too late.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.290
Fang Ruhai sedated his mother as planned

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.140
and ended her life at last.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.200
He already planned to commit suicide.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.480
What turned him into a serial killer?

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.960
Just when Fang Ruhai
was about to commit suicide,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.290
at a fundraising event,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.000
he met Liu Jialiang's mother,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.440
who was there to make donations.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.640
By chance, he learned

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.110
that Liu Jialiang had abused
his own mother.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.870
That was when Fang Ruhai started

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.970
turning into a twisted person.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.550
I believe

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.440
that after he murdered Liu Jialiang,

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.190
he decided to kill

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.310
as many unfilial children as possible

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.510
before his own death.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.270
Just based on what he saw
in that brief moment,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.110
he determined that I was unfilial,

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.170
so he had to kill me?

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.140
Maybe he wasn't like that
in the first place.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.130
Major life changes

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.560
can impact one's state of mind.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.320
I assume you know that well.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.350
What do you mean?

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.520
Let me ask you.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.930
Why did you want to become
a police officer?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.680
I guess

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.000
you made up your mind
to find the killer from years ago

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.200
all by yourself.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.500
So what if that's true?

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.330
This is my fault.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.720
I apologize to you.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.530
I don't expect you to forgive me,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.920
or to understand my actions.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.110
I admit I hate the idea
of you working in the police station.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.640
But if you insist on
continuing with this job,

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.310
don't change yourself
for anyone else.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.370
Juggernaut,

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.710
will the murderer
be identified in the end?

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.110
So far,
Jie seems to be the biggest suspect.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.960
But there may be a twist.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.130
The cleaner could also be a suspect.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.370
Just keep reading and you'll find out.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.070
The murderer isn't Jie,

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.240
but his girlfriend.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.510
It's indicated at the end of chapter two.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.240
Juggernaut,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.960
are we thinking the same way?

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.200
Another murder case with no blood.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.530
Juggernaut does have a consistent style.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.140
Thank you for saving me
in Fang Ruhai's case.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.800
It was you who saved yourself.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.370
But I get to work
in the Police Station...

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.270
That decision was made by the higher-ups,

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.070
not me.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.110
The Police Station is a place

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.680
that values individual ability.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.940
If you don't think
you're suited for this place,

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.510
you may apply to be transferred back
to Inspector Zhu's team

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.140
and resume your old job
of buying breakfast

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.670
and doing archival search.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.020
Don't ever expect me to thank you.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.550
You're overthinking it.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.030
As you're working here,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.350
I have only one requirement for you.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:53.750
That is to obey my orders.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.720
Now, go buy me breakfast.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.590
What?

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.200
Are you serious?

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.030
Of course.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.800
Do I look like I'm joking?

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.890
Buy me some pan-fried buns

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.890
with crispy skin,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.450
plus a bowl of tofu pudding.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.560
What's so good
about the Police Station?

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.020
I still have to tofu pudding
for my boss here.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.790
Inspector.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.690
He's waited a long time for you.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.160
Got it.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.200
Director Huo.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.160
I've transferred an officer
to your unit.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.960
Thank you, Director Huo,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.360
for adding manpower
to the Police Station.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
This is the only place

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.490
where Lu's potential
can be fully realized.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.580
What's your plan?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.000
I'll give her chances to use her strengths

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.440
during case investigations.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.510
I promise to help her live up

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.970
to your expectations for her,
Director Huo.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.920
Really?

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.820
Don't think I'm clueless.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.440
You're working on that old case again,
aren't you?

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.880
The suspect of that case

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.890
from years ago already vanished
without a trace.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.990
Even the only survivor, Lu Yizhen,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.960
can't remember anything.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.000
She lost her memory!

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.720
What leads do you have? How to proceed?

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.160
That gang must be still doing
the same old evil stuff.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.490
It's just what you say. Where's the proof?

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.510
Word has it

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.350
that the mastermind
behind this human trafficking case, Ghost,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.480
has recently reappeared in Shanghai.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.110
Ghost?

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.840
Didn't he flee Shanghai?

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720
An informant said

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.460
the fire back then
was exactly caused by Ghost.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.980
It was that very fire

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.680
that brought Lu Yizhen's case to light.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.030
Nobody saw Ghost again after the fire.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.440
People all thought he had fled Shanghai.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.510
But a source claimed

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.590
to have seen Ghost in Shanghai lately.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.990
And it's highly possible

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.920
that Ghost has never left the city
all this time.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.980
That can't be true.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.510
If he never left Shanghai,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.030
we would have found him already!

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.440
What if
he's been concealing his real identity

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.500
and has cut ties with all his fellows?

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.280
We wouldn't know, would we?

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.730
I suppose that's possible.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.030
I've also heard

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.660
that he was once put in jail

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.160
under a different identity.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.020
That was why we couldn't find him.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.350
He's got some nerve.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.960
Sometimes the most dangerous place

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.400
is the safest place.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.110
Oh, Guan Cen,

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.990
you've been quite busy
behind my back, haven't you?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.580
I need to give myself closure.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:35.860
What closure?

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.600
What are you doing here?

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.550
I was worried
that your breakfast might get cold

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.310
before you ate it, so I brought it over.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.970
I just overheard your conversation
by the door.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.010
You're investigating that old case?

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.790
Didn't I make it clear

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.970
to you at the entrance just now?

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:55.830
I have only one requirement for you

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.680
as you work in the Police Station.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.080
That is to obey my orders.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.830
Sharing the superior's burden

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.070
is also part of my job.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.950
Am I right, Director Huo?

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.220
Since Ghost is in Shanghai,

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.980
he has to interact with others.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.480
Maybe we'll have useful findings

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.350
if we visit the place
where the informant saw Ghost

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.350
and ask around in the neighborhood.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.310
Looks like Inspector Guan and I
have the same idea.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.130
That being the case,

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.730
I request to join the investigation.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.300
No way.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.960
Then forget I was

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.420
ever in this office today.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.640
Lu Yizhen.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240
What do you want?

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.490
Do you really want to join?

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.240
Yes.
