Stop!

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.560
Stop!

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.910
Split up.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.550
Okay.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.190
Hurry, guys! You stop there!

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.440
Stop! Don't run!

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.870
Stop! Don't run!

Stop!

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.830
Stop!

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.720
This way!

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.490
Stop!

[Episode 10]

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.020
Inspector,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.560
I...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.870
There you are.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.590
I placed the files on top of that cabinet.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.450
Don't forget to remind Dong of it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.600
I drew these when I was bored.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.590
I'll help you find her.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.360
Thank you.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.590
Lu Yizhen,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.560
I brought you a salve.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.190
Use it after washing your face,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.320
and then wipe it off.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.050
There's another medicine.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.610
Apply it on your wounds with cotton swabs.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.750
Are you alright?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.970
I'm alright.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.280
Listen,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.120
don't neglect those wounds of yours.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.280
They'll leave scars
if not treated properly.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.520
I do pay attention to them.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.150
I do.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.540
There could be scars. I heard you.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.750
Lu Yizhen.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.079
Lu Yizhen, you seem a bit off.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.279
That's not true.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.230
Let me ask you.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.120
How are things between you and Guan Cen?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.020
He and I were investigating
a case together.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.750
Then I made a mistake.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.070
I should've been the one to be punished.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.800
But instead,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.380
he took the fall for me.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.680
That's not much of a big deal, is it?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.630
He should do that,
since he's your superior.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.710
You've been taken advantage of before.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.830
You've already fallen into
a trap of his design once.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.920
Isn't it enough?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.990
It's not that.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.680
I think...

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.480
this time, he is really not using me.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.750
And there were indeed
misunderstandings between us in the past.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.240
He's tricking you by harming himself.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.040
Aren't you aware of that tactic?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.160
Lu Yizhen,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.390
you have to be extra careful
around this guy.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.800
He is unusually crafty.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.160
Fine. He's conniving.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.780
Can we stop talking about him?

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.310
Recently, I've recalled

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.450
some things about Guan Jingning.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.110
Do you think I should tell him?

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.060
What have you recalled?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.950
Just some fragmented memories.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.570
I remember she was stabbed.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.840
There was a lot of blood.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.110
Well,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.159
no consecutive segments at all?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.650
Just drop it.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.240
Lu Yizhen,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.720
first,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.990
this incident happened many years ago.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.070
The memories you've recovered,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.630
be they about good or bad things,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.390
may not accurately reflect the facts.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.980
Second,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.740
even if what you've recalled
is a good thing,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.480
upon hearing it,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.270
Guan Cen will find some hope at most.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.630
But what if it's a bad thing?

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.560
He'll only feel worse
when he learns about it, right?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.180
Aren't you going to invite me in?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.530
Is that even necessary?

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.810
What kind of attitude is this?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.270
When you asked me to buy you magazines,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.340
you weren't like this at all.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.860
I'm extremely busy every day.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.680
In most cases where you're busy,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.310
you're likely being troubled by an ex,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.120
or dealing with an ex who...

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.680
Stop it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.159
Cut it out now.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.980
When we were in school,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.630
you didn't seem to enjoy reading.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.550
How come you never

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.480
miss an issue of this magazine now?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.160
What?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.430
Do I need to tell you
everything about my life?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.690
Guan, how heartless of you to say that.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.280
As your good friend,
shouldn't I show you some care?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.520
In childhood,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.920
who took you in

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.380
when your dad beat you up?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.870
Who lent you a suit

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.950
for your first date?

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.800
Also, when you first started working
in the Police Station

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.680
and got in trouble, who stood up for you?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.540
How can take this tone with me now?

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.040
Where were you when I took the blame

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.240
for your wrongdoing?

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.360
Didn't you do something
that your dad is still unaware of?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.120
Hey, Guan, stop it.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, it's getting late.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.420
I-I should leave now.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.190
It seems...

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.600
the suspension hasn't affected you much.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.330
Don't forget to close the door.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.830
[The Detective's Casebook]

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.490
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.800
I am Juggernaut.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.870
In terms of experience,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.800
everyone here could be my teacher.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.920
I'm shy of presenting my ideas in front of

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.270
these many seasoned writers.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.240
But I do have a few words to say.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.600
Thanks to your efforts, detective fiction

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.920
has been brought to the current height.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.600
Even I, a layman, gradually

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.270
took a liking to writing

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.120
and courageously made a start.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.000
But indeed,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.830
the development of detective fiction

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.370
is showing signs of stagnation.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.490
Readers are no longer
as enthusiastic as before.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.580
They accept all the works,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.980
regardless of quality.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.840
We are

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.350
thus required to strive for excellence,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.309
hone our skills,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.150
and carve out our own path
among the many genres

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.240
of literary works.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.120
I know it is widely assumed

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.080
that the world of defective fiction
belongs to males,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.870
and that females are emotional

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.870
and weak in logic.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.870
But I think my presence

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.480
has proven it to be a fallacy.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.910
Genders don't matter
when it comes to writing.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.060
Competence is demonstrated by fine works.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.060
Bravo, well said.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.240
I've always been curious

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.270
about one thing.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.480
What is it?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.790
The cases in your novel
are rich in detail.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.320
Ours are no match for yours.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.410
Have you been engaged in criminal cases
in reality?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.660
That's private information.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.200
Sir, I don't think we've met. Who are you?

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.960
I am...

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.030
a reader.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.000
I read about this seminar in a magazine

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.200
and thought it was open to the public.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.720
So, I came specifically to hear
your perspectives as writers.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.120
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.480
So you are a reader.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.480
It's fine.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.950
We should also hear readers' opinions.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.810
May I have your name?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.480
Gu Shuhe.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.480
Never heard of him.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.320
Is this a coincidence or...

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.840
Thank you for accepting our interview.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.550
Thank you.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.080
Goodbye.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.580
I just read about this event

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
in a magazine,

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.870
so I thought I'd come by.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.360
Just a coincidence, huh?

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.790
You happened to have bought a magazine

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.520
that happened to be this issue,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.570
in which you happened to read about
this seminar?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.750
Exactly.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.840
Have you been stalking me, Inspector Guan?

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.240
Me stalking you?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.240
Why else would you care so much
about a subordinate's personal life?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.080
How am I paying attention
to your personal life?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.480
Don't flatter yourself.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.790
I should give Dong and others
a reminder when I get back to work.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.050
A reminder about what?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.270
That they should be careful,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.670
because the great Inspector Guan

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.600
may stalk someone at random times.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.210
-Dad, I’m hungry.
-Why the hurry?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.320
Xiaomin, be good. Just wait a moment.

When these roly-poly toys are sold,

I'll buy you tasty food, okay?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.990
Miss, sir, why not buy a roly-poly toy?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.600
Look, I made these myself.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.240
See the colors and designs?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360
You can't find these anywhere else.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.550
W-Why not show it to your husband, miss?

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.390
You two make a cute couple.

Be good, Xiaomin.
Just wait a moment, okay?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.030
This lady here just bought a sweet potato.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.840
You may eat it.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.330
Sir,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.870
no need for this.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.240
It's okay.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.820
Your child is so adorable.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.530
Thank the gentleman and lady now.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.260
Thank you, sir, miss.

That little girl must be very happy today.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.080
You've given her food.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.410
Of course she's happy.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.200
What to do with these?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.750
You told me to pick these many toys.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.980
They're certainly yours to take home.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.490

for you to get a few days' rest.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.700
It's a delight.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.390
Of course you'd find it a delight,
without my "exploitation" at work.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.650
That's not what I mean.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.630
I know.

Would you like to...
go to a place with me?

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.660
It's neat here.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.690
My dad has this place cleaned every month.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.550
But hasn't your family
settled in Nanyang?

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.930
After all,
this is where my family used to live.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.230
There are memories to cherish, I guess.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.840
Besides, during the previous few visits,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.910
they stayed here.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.960
Why did you suddenly
want to come back here?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.240
It was not that sudden.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.630
Two years ago,
after I learned about that old incident,

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.430
my dad gave me a key to this house.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.200
But I never came back here.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.320
I didn't have a reason

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.130
or the courage to come here.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.960
As it happened, a while ago,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.020
my dad told me he had left a watch here.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.790
He asked me to come get it.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.600
That is why I'm back here.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.050
I feel like I'm intruding into
someone else's world.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.000
You're a whole new Lu Yizhen now.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.720
Of course
you'd find your old self unfamiliar.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.980
But it doesn't matter,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.000
as long as

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.270
you don't let the past hold you back.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.470
I'm actually curious about this place.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.030
Come on.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.880

I have an emergency to deal with.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.110
I need to leave now.

Now, the girl you're into is away,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.960
so you're ditching your dear friend?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.820
No, there is indeed an emergency.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.850
How about...

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.870

if you leave now,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.470

to an abandoned factory

Yes.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.750
I did some research on it.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.000
That fire

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.290
was indeed determined to be an accident.

But if it was really accidental,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.790
why would Lu Yizhen put it

on this board of clues?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.050
Is there something more to it?

of finding useful leads.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.770

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.350
Are you okay?

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.880
Miss,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.610
how did you bump into

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.920
my brother on such a broad road?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.680
I didn't mean to...

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.680
Right! You just wanted to bully a beggar,
didn't you?

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.070
I didn't. It was he who ran into me.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.720
Are you okay?

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.880
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.270
You're planning to dump us
at the hospital, right?

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.270
It's not going to happen!

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.720
We demand money as compensation.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.200
I-I can pay you,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.200
but what if this causes him further harm?

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.720
Let me take you to the hospital. Come on.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.050
Don't worry about that.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.110
All we need is money as compensation.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.170
A couple of silver dollars, at least.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.590
That's mine. Give it back to me.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.270
No way!

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.240
How could you take
someone else's belongings?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.160
Help! We need help! Help!

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.790
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.440
Pay up!

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.390
What's all this noise about?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.510
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.750
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.920
Mr. Du.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.940
Help us!

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.790
This woman wasn't watching
where she was going.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.240
She bumped into my brother.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.790
And now she's being unreasonable.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.320
She's being unreasonable!

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.590
What are you doing?

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.200
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200
Mr. Du, I'm sorry.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840
Your legs are perfectly fine, aren't they?

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.350
Apologize to this lady!

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.270
Sorry, miss.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.070
Sorry, miss.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.880
Sorry, miss.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.510
My apologies, miss.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.770
You broke that, didn't you?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.210
Let it slide.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.680
Fine.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.590
Now that this lady has said so,
I won't pursue further.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.350
However...

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.890
if you ever dare to do this again...

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.350
We won't, Mr. Du.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.270
We won't, Mr. Du.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.960
We won't.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:17.900
Now go away.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.160
Run, guys!

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.910
Hold on.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.800
Buy yourselves some food.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.370
Thank you, Mr. Du.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.980
Thank you, Mr. Du!

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.720
Thank you, Mr. Du!

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720
Thank you, Mr. Du.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.880
We wish you two a lifetime of happiness!

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.250
Dismissed!

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.160
Let's go!

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:36.830
Run!

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.390
Lu Yizhen.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.680
Lu Yizhen, Lu Yizhen!

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.660
What kind of people are you friends with?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.720
They're like younger brothers to me!

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.010
Those kids are still young.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.640
Many of them are orphans.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.450
They're wandering in the streets

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.940
at such young ages
for nothing but survival.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.650
The problem is,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.330
they have a poor sense of judgment,

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.060
given which,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.930
they could easily go astray.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.640
So, I've sent some of them

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.920
to orphanages.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.200
As for those

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.350
who can't be admitted to orphanages,

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.280
I've found places for them to stay.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.240
Although

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.960
the conditions aren't great,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.690
at least they have shelter now.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.840
Who would've thought?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.800
Mr. Du the dandy
is actually a philanthropist.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.680
How is that unexpected?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.320
In your heart,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.750
what exactly am I like?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.560
A playboy?

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.330
A spoiled rich kid exuding arrogance?

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.480
Lu Yizhen, you don't really think of me

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.140
as that kind of person, do you?

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.830
No, I don't.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.120
Why motivates you to help these children?

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:44.910
The story of them and me

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.070
is a long one to tell.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.010
I provide for you!

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.950
Can't you steal money for me?

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.880
It's like I'm raising a piece of trash!

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.160
I-I'm sorry.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.440
I promise I'll bring money back next time.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.400
Next time?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.960
Hey!

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.690
Isn't it time to pay
this month's protection money?

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.800
You've fared well lately, huh?

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.160
No, not at all.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.550
Du,

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.310
is it your wallet?

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.760
Yes.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.000
So you're that informant.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.640
Kiddo.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.070
Here.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.630
Take it.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.930
Be a good person from now on.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.200
Do not steal again.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.640
Thank you, sir.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.640
Thank you.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.500
Thank you, sir.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.110
Since then,

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.510
I began to realize

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.110
many children are homeless, reduced to

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.030
being beggars,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.160
and used by bad people

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.040
for evil purposes.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.400
Maybe for us, the night is a time

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.400
to chill while eating a bowl of wontons
in the streets.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.050
But for those children,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.440
the night is a time

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.290
to sleep out in the open,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.280
to bear the cold,

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.510
to starve,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.680
and to face the constant threat

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.720
of violence.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.080
I couldn't bring myself

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.960
to sit back and do nothing
upon knowing their situation.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.210
I never realized this side of you.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.380
There are many other sides of me.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.730
Care to explore deeper?

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.940
Are you done eating? I should go home now.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.170
It's late. Let me walk you home.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.870
I'll have this fixed for you.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.350
No need to treat me this way.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.020
It's my responsibility
to protect those around me.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.750
You know that's not what I mean.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.110
Director Du,
I think you've probably misinterpreted...

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.170
We need to talk about a serious issue.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.270
Are you investigating that old case?

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.550
How did you know that?

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.130
It must be Si Min...

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.930
Let's go.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.200
We'll talk as we walk.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.210
Morning.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.920
Morning.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.830
Do you like it?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.550
It's a new makeup product,

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.900
supposedly resistant to sunlight and wind.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.880
It's perfect for you, as you're out
for investigations every day.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.510
Thank you.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.860
I appreciate the thought.
But I don't need it, so take it back.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.790
Keep it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.530
It'll come in handy one day.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.760
Director Du!

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.210
Director Du.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.770
Come on.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.590
Here are the files you asked for.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.180
They contain the information

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.350
about the cases proceeded
by the Police Station over these years,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.310
plus the informants' profiles.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.440
Everything's here.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.050
Thanks.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.080
Why do you need this information?

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.920
For smooth transition.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.680
Transition?

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.920
He is an inspector.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.000
Don't you have cases to work on

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.160
in the Intelligence Department?

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.510
Why are you sticking around here?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.520
I do have other work.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.720
But most tasks are minor errands

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.030
involving information sorting.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.890
My subordinates can handle them.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.510
I'm needed here in the Police Station,
aren't I?
