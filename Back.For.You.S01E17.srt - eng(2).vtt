00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.480
Come on, this way.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.120
Slow down.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.320
All right.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.400
I'll go to the hospital with him.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.280
You go back to class.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.240
Teacher Jiang.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.360
Please remind the doctor.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.160
Don't delay it.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.400
He needs Achilles tendon surgery
as soon as possible.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.880
Okay, okay, don't worry.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.640
Classmates.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.800
Hurry back to class.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.400
Let's go.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.880
Just as expected.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.720
Things that are destined

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.360
can't be changed.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.960
What are you thinking about?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.040
Do you think

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.560
after Zhang Xun's leg heals,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.760
can he still join the provincial team?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.720
That's a shame.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.720
By the way,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.760
how did you know

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.000
what's wrong with Zhang Xun's leg?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.840
Achilles tendon rupture.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560
Even the school doctor didn't know.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.480
I guessed.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.000
A friend of mine had an Achilles tendon rupture too.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400
It was just like Zhang Xun's case.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.880
But you seem so sure.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.600
I'm sure about a lot of things.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.920
For example,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.840
our future

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.880
will definitely be bright.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.480
Gather up.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.000
Come on, everyone, gather up.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.640
Classmates.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.280
Today is your last PE class

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.480
in all three years of high school.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.320
Starting today,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440
you won't have PE class anymore.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.600
As for me,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.920
I'm not as talented as your Chinese teacher.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.840
I'll just give you one piece of advice.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.400
The college entrance exam doesn't test PE,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.440
but in the exam of life,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.920
it's your body that matters.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.000
I know

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.560
you envy the younger students.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.800
Just like I envy you.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.520
But

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.000
you're still young.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.080
The future holds endless possibilities.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.520
Classmates.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.040
Do you know

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.400
what it means to have no more PE class?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.680
It means from today, you're all pandas.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.600
You're all protected animals now.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.760
The school is afraid you'll get hurt.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.080
Afraid it'll affect your studies.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.440
But don't overthink it.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.760
Take good care of yourselves.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.440
Just do your best on the college exam.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.240
Life is long.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.840
But time flies.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200
In a blink,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.480
you'll be my age.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.160
So

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
cherish it.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.240
Everyone,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.040
dismissed.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
PE class feels oddly sentimental.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.600
You're getting ready for the after-school broadcast, right?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.120
This is the last time.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.240
I've been a broadcaster for almost two years.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720
It's hard to let go.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.280
I suddenly had a feeling just now

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.040
that we're really about to graduate.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.000
Then say a proper goodbye.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.440
By the way,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.520
can you mention Zhang Xun in your broadcast?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.840
Like wishing him a speedy recovery.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.560
I know he can't hear it,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.560
but I still want to show

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.200
Class 3's feelings.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.080
I'm ready.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.520
Classmates.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.760
You all look great.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.840
It means you're used to the battlefield.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.840
Teacher Jiang.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.200
Is Zhang Xun okay?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.160
Don't worry.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.320
I'll take care of it.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.760
After school today,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.120
don't rush to leave.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.360
There are some key questions.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.400
They're important, I need to explain them.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.680
Is it after school, teacher?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.160
Yes.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.120
You have broadcast station duties.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.800
Yeah.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.120
How about this:

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.160
Don't go to the broadcast station.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.520
I'll have a sophomore take your place.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.160
Come on, class leader.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.320
Let's go back together tonight.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.600
It's fine, no need.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.000
I can handle it alone.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.400
You can't do the broadcast today.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.880
You're upset, aren't you?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.560
No.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.160
I'm not that fragile.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800
Brother Nan, I found out.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.920
The person doing the broadcast after school

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.560
is a girl from sophomore class eight.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.600
What's her name?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.880
Lou Yuting.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.560
Thanks, I'll buy you milk tea tonight.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.240
Okay.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.600
Lou Yuting.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.200
Of the seniors, I think Zhang Han is the most handsome.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.520
Zhang Han? No way, he's too plain.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.520
What do you think, Yuting?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.760
I think...

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.880
Isn't it obvious?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.320
She definitely thinks Ren Nan is the most handsome.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320
Alright.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.400
Then you have no chance, Yuting.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.960
Ren Nan already likes someone.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.520
Seems it's someone from his class.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.360
Her name is Su Ruo.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.720
I wasn't expecting anything anyway.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.760
Don't spread rumors.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.920
Let me tell you,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.520
Classmate,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.440
is there a Lou Yuting in your class?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.600
I'm Ren Nan from Class 3, senior year.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.640
I'll keep it brief.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.760
I need your help with something.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.600
Mm.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.720
Go ahead.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.640
You're hosting the broadcast tonight, right?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.160
How did you know?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.360
Will you be listening too?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.680
Don't go tonight.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120
Su Ruo from our class is hosting tonight.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.800
How can that be?

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.200
The teacher assigned it.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.560
I don't care.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.680
Whether you skip it,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.640
or stand them up,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.120
just don't go.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.960
Here.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.440
I don't want it.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.360
You won't listen to reason, huh?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.520
Let me say it again.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.720
Tonight's host

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.360
must be Su Ruo from our class.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.640
Why are you speaking for her?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.760
I'm not speaking for her.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.200
The teacher decided.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.920
How can you be like this?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.000
Ren Nan.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.440
Ren Nan, what are you doing?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.160
It's the teacher's arrangement.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.600
Why are you taking it out on her?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.080
Don't be scared.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.240
It's your first time broadcasting, right?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.480
Good luck! Do your best, don't be nervous.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.040
Su Ruo.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.040
Hey.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.200
I heard everything you just said.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.600
Hello.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.720
I'm in the same class as those two.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.880
My name is Yu Xingchen.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.440
Are you here to tell me not to host, too?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.160
Of course not.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.440
The teacher gave you this job.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.440
You should do your best.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.600
Broadcast with focus.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.800
Thank you.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.000
Ren Nan isn't a bad person.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320
He just cares too much about the girls.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.760
So when he sees a girl upset,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.000
he wants to stand up for her.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.320
Don't take it to heart.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.480
I'm not mad at him.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.160
Can you return this money to Ren Nan for me?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.120
Sure.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.800
I'll let him know later.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.680
Anything else you want me to tell him?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.920
Please tell him

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.160
I'm not mad at him, that's all.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.960
No problem.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.720
Actually,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.200
I have one more favor to ask.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.080
What do you mean?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.360
Do you think I care about this two hundred yuan?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.040
If someone tells the teacher,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.120
you'll be in real trouble.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.920
You know that?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.120
What do you call this?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.120
Bribing a classmate.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.200
Yu Xingchen, you really meddle too much.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080
If you have money to burn,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.440
share some with me.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.080
I'm buying Su Ruo milk tea.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.000
Hello, everyone.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.200
It's time for Melody Date on Wednesday evening.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.400
Youth is white,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.640
like fragrant wild lilies.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.840
Unwilling to be unseen, it blooms in spring.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.480
Youth is purple,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640
like brilliant lilacs.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.360
Showing the world your unique self.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.600
Let's go.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.000
I'll take you somewhere.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.280
Where to?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.040
To say a proper goodbye.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.240
Where did you get the studio key?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.040
I asked Lou Yuting for it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440
I told her

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.960
that each of us

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.000
needs a chance to say goodbye.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040
We're seniors now.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.320
We'll graduate in a few months.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.280
No one will

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.760
be this strict with them anymore.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.640
Yeah.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.080
SPRING PROMISE CAMPUS RADIO

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.040
A busy week,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.520
a relaxing moment now.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.680
Hello, I'm your host, Su Ruo.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.800
It's another night of self-study battles.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.160
Surprised to hear my voice tonight?

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.800
But today

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.200
might be

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.160
the last time you hear me.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.040
In our imagination,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.680
high school life feels long.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.360
Every day of going to and from school.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.200
Why is the broadcast on now?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.680
That's against the rules.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.000
We're young.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.280
Young people should act young.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.760
Listen.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.200
Listen closely.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.320
During my time hosting here,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.320
I've played songs for many teachers and classmates.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.920
But today's first song

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.880
is for my own eighteen years.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.720
I also want to dedicate it

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.640
to all senior teachers and students fighting hard.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.480
No matter the outcome,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.200
at least we've all tried.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.600
And

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.880
I want to say to Zhang Xun from Class 3,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.280
get well soon.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.080
Everyone in Class 3 is waiting for you.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.120
That's wonderful.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.640
So many blessings.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.520
Stay positive.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.960
Defending his own.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.040
Others may not know, but I do, Director.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.280
The most protective at Minghe Middle School

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.680
is you.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.720
Youth will fade.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.960
Time never stops.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.560
But we, in our prime,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.160
are the youths of this moment, full of possibility.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.040
Everything is just right.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.360
Because of the college entrance exam,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.960
I have to say goodbye for now.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.560
But the broadcast station will always be with you.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.160
Youth won't fade.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.520
Friendship won't fade either.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.560
I'm Su Ruo.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.480
Good night, everyone.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.560
I have work tomorrow.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.520
Let's talk about it tomorrow
if there's anything.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.720
Did you do something?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.880
Sorry, is this about me?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.600
What?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.560
Today, Yu Xingchen said
some really strange things to me.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.320
You didn't tell him anything,
did you?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.720
I feel like he knows something.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
Let me ask you.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.520
If Mei Xian tried to get close to you,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.680
would you be interested?

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.000
Mei Xian? Who's that?

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.480
Pretending.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.120
You clearly have Mei Xian
on your mind.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.240
You keep thinking about her.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.960
And you still won't admit it.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.840
Didn't you tell Yu Xingchen?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.040
How else would he know?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.200
Wait, who exactly is Mei Xian?

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.400
You really don't know
who Mei Xian is?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.000
How would I know?
