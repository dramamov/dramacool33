Hello, Mr. Meng.

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:24.496
I've arrived.

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:25.816
I'm already in Heyang.

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:28.336
No need.

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:29.575
I've already eaten.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:31.216
Besides, I'm meeting a friend tonight.

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:32.695
Right.

00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:34.376
How about this?

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.575
Could we have lunch together tomorrow?

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:38.695
Great. That works.

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:42.295
Then please send me the time and place.

00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:43.816
Okay.

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:45.336
See you tomorrow, Mr. Meng.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:46.855
Goodbye.

00:03:59.496 --> 00:03:59.976
Bravo!

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.295

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:03.256

Another one!

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:04.855
Another dance!

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:06.816
Another one!

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:14.656
Xu Anni.

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:16.815
Hello.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.295
Tell your boss
that no one can change my mind.

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:22.855
I said I'm not going.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.576
I told him I have a boyfriend.

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.415
You might've misunderstood.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.976
There's an opening event
at Fengyun Plaza tomorrow.

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:32.175
Could you help us liven up the venue?

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:35.415
Are you...

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.255
I'm the event organizer.

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:38.495
We can discuss the price.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:41.456
Sorry, I thought...

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.055
We've had shady people
approach us before.

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:46.935
I thought you were one of them.

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:47.815
My apologies.

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:48.336
It's okay.

00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:49.096
Please sit.

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:49.615
Okay.

00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:53.696
You said tomorrow?

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:54.216
Yes.

00:04:54.415 --> 00:04:55.016
Can you do it?

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:56.735
I can't make it tomorrow.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.136
I'm booked here through next week.

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:00.615
Then...

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:02.976
Could you make an exception?

00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:05.415
I'm afraid not.

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:07.456
The owner here is very kind.

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.576
He booked me for ten shows
without haggling.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:10.935
I've only done two so far.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:11.855
I can't leave now.

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.055
Maybe next time?

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:15.776
Okay.

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:16.976
It's a shame.

00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.175
Let me get your contact info.

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.175
I'll contact you again.

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:24.776
I'll pay the deposit first.

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:26.776
No need. Pay after the show.
It's the rule.

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:31.016
That pendant's unique.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:32.016
Did you make it?

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:33.096
This?

00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:35.055
I made it.

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:37.696
I've loved crafts since childhood.

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:38.815
So in my free time,

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:40.096
I tinker with these things.

00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:46.976
What happened to you?

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:50.336
My...

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.295
My boyfriend

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:53.696
had a few drinks

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:55.216
and got rough.

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.735
You can't let that slide.

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:03.536
Once men do it once,

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:05.656
they'll do it again and again.

00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:08.576
Your boyfriend

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.216
does this to you too?

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:12.136
No.

00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:13.495
He treats me very well.

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:15.735
Let me tell you.

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:19.495
You've got to meet a few
to find the one.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:21.935
If you're lucky someday,

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:23.615
you'll find the one meant for you.

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:26.495
My ex was no good either.

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:28.375
He's the same, always violent.

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:30.576
But I didn't take it lying down.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:32.375
I fought back every time.

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.216
The neighbors called the police.

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:38.295
At least you've met someone
who treats you well now.

00:06:44.456 --> 00:06:46.615
I grew up without parents,
naive about everything.

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:48.815
I met a guy and impulsively ran off.

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:50.855
It's my fault

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.696
for trusting others too much.

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:55.336
But now

00:06:56.136 --> 00:06:57.656
things are truly different.

00:06:58.055 --> 00:06:59.136
I feel much more grounded.

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:02.336
What does your boyfriend do?

00:07:03.295 --> 00:07:04.456
Driving for hire around town.

00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:07.216
He said yesterday he'd come home late.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:09.175
A simple man.

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:11.815
I don't expect him

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:12.935
to strike it rich.

00:07:13.576 --> 00:07:14.495
But towards me,

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:17.255
his heart is genuine.

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:21.415
I really envy you.

00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:29.855
You'll find someone too.

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:33.016
But not the current one.

00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:34.255
Dump him quickly.

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:42.415
Well,

00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:44.576
I won't disturb your work anymore.

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:46.456
I'll call you next time I need help.

00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:47.415
Okay. Do call me.

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:49.896
Bye-bye.

00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:13.336
Not going well?

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:15.096
Too well, actually.

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.495
I didn't even need to try.

00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:17.656
She offered it up freely.

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:19.776
Then why the long face?

00:08:22.776 --> 00:08:23.656
I think

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:26.336
she's lived in her own world,

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:27.776
unaware of everything

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:29.336
and believing she's truly happy.

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:36.416
Being kept in the dark

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.615
makes her carefree.

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:42.615
Just like me.

00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:44.976
Those years
before reading my mom's diary,

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:47.176
I was happy too.

00:08:56.976 --> 00:08:58.056
And what about the date?

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.176
I asked about that too.

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.375
No particular reaction from her.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.296
Probably doesn't know.

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.495
I messaged her pretending to be Chen Fu.

00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:08.135
Let's keep her calm for now.

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:09.576
But I'm not sure for how long.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.984
Either she suspects, or someone comes.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:12.976
Neither will take long.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:15.655
One more day?

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:18.135
Hopefully.

00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:37.775
(Mengjiu Seafood Stall)

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:38.615
Just one room?

00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:40.696
It's the peak season.

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.296
We only have this
because someone canceled.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.416
Without it, we'd be full
for the next two weeks.

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:47.976
Any other hotels nearby?

00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:49.936
There's a guesthouse behind.

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:51.135
You could check there.

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:53.336
A guesthouse?

00:09:53.615 --> 00:09:54.775
No guesthouse.

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.176
We'll take this room first.

00:09:57.015 --> 00:09:57.655
You stay here.

00:09:57.655 --> 00:09:59.056
I'll crash in my car tonight.

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.056
What's the room type?

00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:01.456
Deluxe king suite.

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.576
Comes with a sofa and chaise lounge.

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:05.855
You can sleep on them too.

00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:08.255
Alright, let's check it out first.

00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:10.096
Right this way, please.

00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:30.535
It's actually quite cozy.

00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:31.375
You take this.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:33.615
It'll be awkward.

00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:38.336
Then I... I'll sleep here.

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:39.096
You take the bed.

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:39.775
Wait.

00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:41.655
We can't sleep without a partition.

00:10:45.176 --> 00:10:45.816
Shy about it?

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:49.855
Not afraid I'll take advantage?

00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:51.296
Why would I be?

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:52.416
You can't beat me anyway.

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:00.735
Fine, I'll sleep here then.

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:02.816
Sleeping already?

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:04.495
Let's go.

00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:05.096
Where to?

00:11:05.535 --> 00:11:07.056
To eat. Been starving all day.

00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:09.495
Keep up.

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:11.976
(Red Coral Braised Delicacies)

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:12.696
Good, right?

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:14.375
Yes.

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:16.015
I came here last time with that guy.

00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:18.296
Good for you.

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:19.576
Great find.

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:21.096
Of course.

00:11:21.296 --> 00:11:22.576
I'm putting you to the test

00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:24.296
to see which is better, the Heyang

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:25.336
or Xicang braised food?

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:27.216
Alright, we'll find out later.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.456
What would you like to order?

00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:42.176
He's asking you.

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:45.375
Let her order.

00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:46.576
She's the expert.

00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:52.056
So many choices.

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:54.576
Recommend some for us.

00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:55.735
Which are the best?

00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:57.495
The Long Intestines,

00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.015
Chicken Neck Club,

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.056
The Wing-shank Redemption,

00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:02.895
Four Meats and One Offal...

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:05.576
(Tuo, look. There's someone
selling ducklings over there.)

00:12:05.576 --> 00:12:07.855
(Let's go take a look together.)

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:11.976
(Tuo, why haven't you
come to find me yet?)

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:14.816
These are all bestsellers.

00:12:17.255 --> 00:12:19.176
Then let's order one of each.

00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:19.816
Is that okay?

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:22.336
Can you two finish all that?

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:24.135
If we can't finish it all,

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:26.336
will you and your sister join us?

00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:28.576
Welcome.

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:31.855
Don't say 'welcome.' Say 'thank you.'

00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:34.015
Saying 'welcome' is fine too.

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:35.936
Wait a moment.

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:37.015
Food's ready soon.

00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:38.296
Okay, here you are.

00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:02.936
Jiang always said,

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:05.296
"If you have things on your mind,

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:06.655
you'll ruin the meal."

00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:08.135
Let's drink

00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:10.416
to relax and whet our appetite.

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:12.655
May things go well

00:13:12.976 --> 00:13:13.816
as we wish.

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:17.296
Definitely.

00:13:23.176 --> 00:13:25.615
How do you entertain clients
when you can't hold your liquor?

00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:29.015
No. The wine wasn't right.

00:13:29.936 --> 00:13:32.015
D-Did you drug me?

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:35.495
Yes, I drugged you

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:36.895
to knock you out cold,

00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:38.655
making you a perfect bargaining chip

00:13:38.896 --> 00:13:40.056
when dealing with Lin Xirou.

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:42.855
No.

00:13:43.336 --> 00:13:44.056
It wasn't right.

00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:45.418
The wine wasn't right.

00:13:49.135 --> 00:13:50.176
Nothing was in the wine.

00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:52.015
It's your heart that's burdened.

00:13:52.775 --> 00:13:53.696
My heart...

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:56.296
My heart is clear and open.

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:57.336
There's nothing there.

00:13:57.816 --> 00:13:58.615
Nothing.

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:01.816
There's a nail in your heart.

00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:06.696
What?

00:14:15.056 --> 00:14:16.456
A nail embedded in your flesh.

00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:21.336
Over time, you think it's harmless,

00:14:22.855 --> 00:14:24.255
but a sudden prick

00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:25.775
still brings sharp pain.

00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:34.336
(You've got to)

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.456
(meet a few to find the one.)

00:15:37.096 --> 00:15:38.855
(If you're lucky someday,)

00:15:39.152 --> 00:15:40.592
(you'll find the one meant for you.)

00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:27.255
Hello?

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:28.895
Mr. Meng, sorry about earlier.

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:31.176
The signal was bad,
and I couldn't hear clearly.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.456
Could you please repeat that?

00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:36.855
Here's the thing, Mr. Xiong.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.416
I was supposed to meet Mr. Yan

00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:40.015
this morning,

00:16:40.255 --> 00:16:42.255
but something came up,

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:44.655
so I needed to reschedule.

00:16:45.056 --> 00:16:46.336
However, since last night,

00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:47.895
I haven't been able to reach Mr. Yan.

00:16:49.056 --> 00:16:50.135
He isn't picking up.

00:16:50.535 --> 00:16:52.576
Could you please contact him for me?

00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:54.535
Okay, got it.

00:16:54.976 --> 00:16:55.855
I'll check with him.

00:16:57.456 --> 00:16:58.735
Thank you, Mr. Xiong.

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:00.936
Apologies for the trouble.

00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:02.696
I'm truly sorry.

00:17:32.976 --> 00:17:33.575
Thank you.

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:43.575
Lili.

00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:45.495
Here are the microphones.

00:17:45.896 --> 00:17:46.696
Thanks, Anni.

00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:47.495
No problem.

00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:55.055
Anni, you're here.

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:56.535
Sir.

00:17:56.896 --> 00:17:58.055
How's the gig scene lately?

00:17:59.176 --> 00:17:59.936
It's going well.

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:01.896
Sing your best.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:03.976
We can get you an exclusive contract.

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:06.015
This place can become your main stage.

00:18:07.735 --> 00:18:08.535
We'll see.

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:15.735
I'll go touch up my makeup now.

00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:17.055
The show's about to start.

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:17.976
Stay for a bit.

00:18:17.976 --> 00:18:18.575
I'm leaving.

00:18:18.656 --> 00:18:19.456
No rush.

00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:34.095
Hurry up.

00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:35.176
The show's starting soon.

00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:36.015
Okay.

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:22.800
(Mr. Meng, Voice Message)

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.176
(Missed Calls of Mr. Meng, Heyang)

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.976
(Mr. Meng)

00:19:28.976 --> 00:19:29.735
Mr. Yan,

00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:31.095
I couldn't reach you.

00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:32.295
I'll leave you a message.

00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:34.136
My kid fell ill and was hospitalized.

00:19:34.136 --> 00:19:35.255
I need to go to Xicang

00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:36.376
to visit a doctor friend.

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:37.775
Can we reschedule?

00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:40.055
How about a few more days in Heyang?

00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:41.696
Or I'll stay once I'm done in Xicang.

00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:42.416
We can meet

00:19:42.495 --> 00:19:43.295
when you're back.

00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.055
I'm really sorry.

00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:45.896
What happened...

00:20:01.216 --> 00:20:01.896
Ms. Lin.

00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:03.295
Where are you?

00:20:03.696 --> 00:20:04.535
In Heyang.

00:20:04.856 --> 00:20:05.575
Heyang?

00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:06.376
Right.

00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:08.416
Meeting Mr. Meng
of Chinese medicine purification.

00:20:08.656 --> 00:20:09.896
Didn't I tell you before?

00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:11.376
How did it go?

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:13.616
It went well. Mr. Meng is decent.

00:20:13.936 --> 00:20:14.616
Is that so?

00:20:15.055 --> 00:20:15.616
Yes.

00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:18.775
Moreover, I think
with one or two more follow-ups,

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.335
we'll probably seal the deal.

00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:22.936
Why did Mr. Meng say
he couldn't reach you?

00:20:32.216 --> 00:20:33.295
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:34.015
Well...

00:20:34.015 --> 00:20:36.856
I-I drank too much
with a friend yesterday.

00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:38.176
I missed Mr. Meng's calls.

00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:39.856
What friend?

00:20:41.416 --> 00:20:42.495
J-Just an online friend.

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:44.856
I told you about this.

00:20:44.896 --> 00:20:46.055
You're not a child anymore.

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:47.456
You're Roadsound's future.

00:20:50.055 --> 00:20:50.656
Understood.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.176
I'll make it a priority
to meet with Mr. Meng

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.416
and lock in our cooperation.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.856
Before making any decisions,

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.335
consider the group

00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:00.535
and our family first.

00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:01.775
Not just yourself.

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:05.696
Understood, Ms. Lin.

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:06.815
My apologies.

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:23.760
(I'm on Xu Anni.
Catch up after you rest)

00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:42.815
Could you get me a cup?

00:21:43.495 --> 00:21:44.055
Here.

00:21:44.976 --> 00:21:45.575
Thanks.

00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:46.136
No problem.

00:22:06.055 --> 00:22:08.815
I... didn't do anything embarrassing

00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:09.896
last night, right?

00:22:12.295 --> 00:22:13.015
You forgot?

00:22:15.255 --> 00:22:16.896
What should I remember?

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.295
Don't tell me you'll back out

00:22:19.295 --> 00:22:20.176
of your promises

00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:21.456
now that you're sober.

00:22:21.815 --> 00:22:22.856
What did I promise?

00:22:27.376 --> 00:22:28.335
You promised

00:22:31.335 --> 00:22:32.735
to support my art career.

00:22:35.616 --> 00:22:36.255
Only that?

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:39.255
Right.

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:40.896
Now I remember. I did say that.

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:42.176
After all this time,

00:22:42.176 --> 00:22:43.656
supporting you is natural, right?

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:46.216
You also promised

00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:48.176
to book the Yanguan Art Museum

00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:49.575
for an entire month

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:51.015
for my solo exhibition.

00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:57.775
How do you

00:22:57.775 --> 00:22:59.216
hold your liquor at events?

00:22:59.335 --> 00:23:00.936
If beer does this to you,

00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:02.216
you'd be kidney-less

00:23:02.335 --> 00:23:03.856
with hard liquor.

00:23:03.896 --> 00:23:05.136
Thank you

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:06.335
for my kidneys then.

00:23:06.575 --> 00:23:07.335
You're welcome.

00:23:07.656 --> 00:23:08.735
Your kidneys remain,

00:23:09.176 --> 00:23:10.055
but not your dignity.

00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:16.255
How's Xu Anni?

00:23:19.216 --> 00:23:20.815
That one's been standing a while,

00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:22.376
pretending to be a tourist

00:23:22.616 --> 00:23:24.495
and snapping water, boats, and birds.

00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:29.896
But he's actually
watching Xu Anni, right?

00:23:30.295 --> 00:23:31.656
Sharp observation, Mr. Yan.

00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:33.255
After sleeping half the day,

00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:34.856
now you have it all figured out?

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:40.936
Alright.

00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:42.416
You think I'm all talk?

00:23:46.775 --> 00:23:47.416
Wait here.

00:23:47.775 --> 00:23:48.575
Where are you going?

00:23:55.656 --> 00:23:58.095
This angle won't capture everything.

00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:01.936
Hey, bro.

00:24:02.255 --> 00:24:03.015
Mind helping

00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:04.815
take a photo for me?

00:24:04.815 --> 00:24:05.575
It's for my wife.

00:24:05.575 --> 00:24:06.295
I'm in a hurry.

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:07.255
It'll be quick.

00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:08.656
Appreciate it. Thanks.

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:10.136
Here, aim like this.

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:12.136
Take more.

00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:12.656
Okay. Done.

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:13.216
More shots.

00:24:13.216 --> 00:24:14.136
Get this boat

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:15.255
in the frame.

00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:16.015
Right.

00:24:16.015 --> 00:24:16.976
Use it as a background.

00:24:17.696 --> 00:24:18.376
Right.

00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:19.216
More shots.

00:24:19.216 --> 00:24:20.176
Come on, like this.

00:24:21.936 --> 00:24:22.735
Bro, how about

00:24:22.735 --> 00:24:24.616
you step back over there?

00:24:24.616 --> 00:24:25.216
To the railing.

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.976
And capture everything here.

00:24:27.015 --> 00:24:27.775
It'll look good.

00:24:27.856 --> 00:24:28.696
The view is great.

00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:29.696
Thanks.

00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:33.856
Take a few more.

00:24:36.255 --> 00:24:37.255
More shots.

00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:39.896
Done.

00:24:40.216 --> 00:24:41.015
Thank you.

00:24:41.335 --> 00:24:42.896
Bro, wait a second.

00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:43.976
Let me check.

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:44.616
Let me check.

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:45.735
Maybe we'll have to reshoot.

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:49.976
Not bad. That chick's hot.

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:52.095
Check out that leopard print. Cute, huh?

00:24:53.616 --> 00:24:54.775
Hey, are you a local?

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:57.216
I'm a tourist.

00:24:57.656 --> 00:24:58.696
Same here.

00:24:59.255 --> 00:25:00.936
Most people avoid coming to Heyang.

00:25:00.936 --> 00:25:02.055
Too rundown for them.

00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:03.696
But you need an eye

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.015
for finding beauty in things.

00:25:05.176 --> 00:25:06.416
Seems like you've got that eye.

00:25:06.575 --> 00:25:07.456
I've got things to do.

00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:08.456
Wait, bro.

00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:09.376
How about this?

00:25:09.376 --> 00:25:10.896
Let's take a photo together.

00:25:11.575 --> 00:25:12.696
No photos with strangers.

00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:14.335
Well, it's for my wife.

00:25:14.335 --> 00:25:15.856
She thinks I came here with some girl.

00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:16.775
I can't do that.

00:25:16.775 --> 00:25:17.815
Let's take one.

00:25:17.815 --> 00:25:18.616
You take it for me.

00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:21.055
Bro, look at this.

00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:22.136
Are you out of your mind?

00:25:22.136 --> 00:25:23.295
It's broken. What's inside?

00:25:23.295 --> 00:25:23.775
Get lost.

00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:24.656
Sorry about that.

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:26.216
Hey, don't get mad.

00:25:42.064 --> 00:25:43.655
(Yan Tuo)

00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:52.735
That guy is up to no good.

00:25:52.856 --> 00:25:54.295
He probably had ether in his bag.

00:25:55.575 --> 00:25:56.376
How do you know?

00:25:56.535 --> 00:25:57.416
I smelled it.

00:25:58.255 --> 00:25:59.295
You have skills like that?

00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:03.335
Before taking over Roadsound,

00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:04.416
it was all lab work.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.295
As the General Manager
of Yanguan's largest pharma group,

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:08.775
I know my field.

00:26:12.095 --> 00:26:13.015
So not all rich heirs

00:26:13.015 --> 00:26:14.856
are complete slackers.

00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:20.656
Enough chatter.

00:26:21.775 --> 00:26:22.896
That guy's plan was ruined.

00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:23.896
He'll come back.

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:24.815
Keep watching.

00:26:26.495 --> 00:26:27.376
Let's move.

00:26:27.775 --> 00:26:29.696
Xu Anni saw me sitting here too long.

00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:34.416
How about this?

00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:36.095
Let's get food to eat in the car.

00:26:36.616 --> 00:26:37.936
Fine, order whatever.

00:26:38.216 --> 00:26:39.216
Just don't drink.

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:51.015
I'd like to order.

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:02.176
We're searching blindly.

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:04.416
When will we ever find it like this?

00:27:05.055 --> 00:27:05.976
You never stop talking.

00:27:06.216 --> 00:27:07.216
Blabbered the whole way.

00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:08.815
Can't find it, can't go back.

00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:10.295
Just wasting time out here.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.176
Who wants this?

00:27:13.456 --> 00:27:14.535
Shut up already.

00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:15.976
I'm stressed enough.

00:27:16.255 --> 00:27:17.456
I don't want your yapping.

00:27:17.456 --> 00:27:18.775
I'm annoyed too.

00:27:18.936 --> 00:27:20.775
Xiong treats us like dogs, you know.

00:27:20.775 --> 00:27:21.815
Dogs at least get cans.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.976
This team's management style

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:24.976
will cause problems soon.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:25.976
Then quit searching.

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:28.495
Xiong will hit me.

00:27:28.696 --> 00:27:29.856
You deserve that.

00:27:29.936 --> 00:27:31.095
Then I'll hit you.

00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:14.216
Such delicious food.

00:28:14.376 --> 00:28:15.775
Give it here if you won't eat.

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:18.696
You love cilantro this much?

00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.775
It's called 'Fragrant Green' too.

00:28:20.856 --> 00:28:22.335
Because it's fragrant. Tasty.

00:28:22.735 --> 00:28:23.696
Unreasonable.

00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:27.015
Tell me all your dietary restrictions.

00:28:27.095 --> 00:28:28.456
I'll remember for next time.

00:28:40.696 --> 00:28:42.255
Among us South Mountain Hunters,

00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:44.896
the Hound Clan has the most members.

00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:48.335
Any pungent smells

00:28:48.976 --> 00:28:50.735
interfere with their tracking senses.

00:28:51.815 --> 00:28:53.095
So since childhood,

00:28:53.936 --> 00:28:56.176
we've eaten bland food
without chili, ginger, garlic,

00:28:56.575 --> 00:28:58.255
or cilantro as seasonings.

00:29:00.696 --> 00:29:02.495
But Jiang loves them,

00:29:03.376 --> 00:29:04.535
especially ginger.

00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.456
After every mountain patrol,

00:29:09.575 --> 00:29:11.416
he'd take me for sashimi.

00:29:13.535 --> 00:29:14.976
He'd give me all the fish meat

00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:18.335
and save the ginger for himself.

00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:24.015
Don't worry.

00:29:25.136 --> 00:29:26.376
We'll definitely rescue him.

00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:32.416
And you'll find your sister too.

00:29:40.335 --> 00:29:41.095
What are you doing?

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:47.136
Excuse me,

00:29:47.896 --> 00:29:48.456
bro.

00:29:48.656 --> 00:29:50.656
I noticed your license plate
is from Xicang.

00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:52.176
When you came here,

00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:53.815
did you take the Xincang route?

00:29:54.495 --> 00:29:56.176
Yes, I did.

00:29:56.176 --> 00:29:56.815
Well,

00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:58.376
a friend of mine is coming from there.

00:29:58.376 --> 00:29:59.735
What are the road conditions?

00:29:59.735 --> 00:30:00.456
Is it passable?

00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:01.616
No checkpoints.

00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:02.535
It's pretty smooth.

00:30:02.656 --> 00:30:02.936
Yeah.

00:30:02.976 --> 00:30:03.775
Okay, great.

00:30:03.775 --> 00:30:05.015
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:06.575
Not at all. Perfect timing.

00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:37.335
Well,

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.495
smooth energy flow
ensures blood circulation.

00:30:39.775 --> 00:30:41.735
Stagnant energy causes blood stagnation.

00:30:42.696 --> 00:30:44.456
Once the energy flows freely,

00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:46.295
all else follows smoothly.

00:30:47.376 --> 00:30:48.456
And the opposite?

00:30:49.295 --> 00:30:50.775
If the heart meridian gets blocked,

00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:53.896
worries will accumulate like knots.

00:30:54.136 --> 00:30:55.696
Even without major issues,

00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:58.095
minor troubles will persist.

00:30:59.376 --> 00:31:01.696
'Free from worries' sounds easy.

00:31:05.896 --> 00:31:06.535
Ms. Lin,

00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:08.656
if you have any worries,

00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:10.136
vent to me.

00:31:11.216 --> 00:31:12.815
Maybe I can't solve them,

00:31:13.216 --> 00:31:14.735
but sharing helps relieve stress.

00:31:15.255 --> 00:31:17.976
My worries
could fill three days and nights.

00:31:19.015 --> 00:31:21.535
But if you ask about joys,

00:31:21.696 --> 00:31:23.535
I'd need time to think.

00:31:26.535 --> 00:31:27.216
Right.

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:29.936
As Roadsound Group's leader,

00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:31.856
you're busy.

00:31:32.815 --> 00:31:33.775
We underlings

00:31:33.775 --> 00:31:35.456
can't possibly understand

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:37.456
your pressures.

00:31:38.095 --> 00:31:39.456
Just remember my words.

00:31:39.976 --> 00:31:41.616
Smooth energy brings peace of mind.

00:31:43.216 --> 00:31:44.656
Today's moxibustion worked well.

00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:46.136
Follow my prescription

00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:47.456
for two more doses,

00:31:47.896 --> 00:31:49.976
and happy memories will return.

00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:53.696
Could you and Lin Ling ease my worries?

00:31:57.575 --> 00:31:58.216
Ms. Lin,

00:31:58.775 --> 00:31:59.535
what do you mean?

00:31:59.815 --> 00:32:01.255
Have we upset you?

00:32:02.055 --> 00:32:03.896
You're not toying with her, are you?

00:32:08.255 --> 00:32:10.136
How should I put this?

00:32:12.616 --> 00:32:13.295
Ms. Lin,

00:32:14.095 --> 00:32:15.015
you think

00:32:15.136 --> 00:32:17.775
I act brash normally,

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.495
but when it's serious,

00:32:21.176 --> 00:32:22.735
I get more nervous than anyone.

00:32:23.616 --> 00:32:25.735
Wanbao Tower sounds grand,

00:32:26.176 --> 00:32:27.735
but it's just a small workshop.

00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:30.015
Without your support, I'd be a tramp.

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:31.696
As for Roadsound,

00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:34.696
it's an unreachable summit.

00:32:35.575 --> 00:32:37.856
My humble career

00:32:38.335 --> 00:32:40.735
serving you diligently

00:32:40.735 --> 00:32:42.456
is already my family's greatest honor.

00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:45.495
The young mistress is beyond my reach.

00:32:45.976 --> 00:32:49.416
If everything followed logic,

00:32:49.616 --> 00:32:50.896
how boring life would be.

00:32:52.936 --> 00:32:54.696
Great achievements require risks

00:32:54.696 --> 00:32:55.936
and struggles.

00:32:59.295 --> 00:33:00.936
This is too great.

00:33:01.856 --> 00:33:02.976
A lifelong commitment.

00:33:07.976 --> 00:33:09.856
I'm honored by your confidence

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:11.896
and won't disappoint you.

00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:14.495
With your blessing, I'll move forward.

00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:22.696
Not just walk far,

00:33:23.295 --> 00:33:24.896
but walk faster too.

00:33:37.535 --> 00:33:38.735
Enough already.

00:33:38.735 --> 00:33:40.015
I've honored my word.

00:33:42.176 --> 00:33:43.495
It's time to clock out.

00:33:43.775 --> 00:33:44.535
Drink less.

00:33:47.095 --> 00:33:48.095
Leaving together?

00:33:48.575 --> 00:33:49.575
You go ahead.

00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:51.095
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:34.695
We meet again.

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:37.615
It's you.

00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:39.135
What are you doing?

00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:40.175
Let me go.

00:35:40.215 --> 00:35:40.816
Don't move.

00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:46.135
Why were you following Xu Anni?

00:35:47.615 --> 00:35:48.336
Who?

00:35:48.736 --> 00:35:50.055
Not sure what you mean.

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.456
Let me go.

00:35:52.615 --> 00:35:53.816
Did you hear me?

00:35:53.936 --> 00:35:54.856
I'll call the police.

00:35:54.856 --> 00:35:55.896
Not cooperating, huh?

00:35:57.376 --> 00:35:58.376
Want to call the police?

00:35:58.936 --> 00:35:59.695
Perfect.

00:35:59.736 --> 00:36:00.695
Explain this

00:36:00.695 --> 00:36:01.535
to the police.

00:36:03.736 --> 00:36:04.736
W-What is this?

00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:06.736
I really don't know.

00:36:06.736 --> 00:36:07.535
It isn't mine.

00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:09.175
It's in your bag. You don't know?

00:36:09.175 --> 00:36:10.175
It isn't yours?

00:36:17.095 --> 00:36:18.495
If you have no shame,

00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:19.896
I'll help redden your face.

00:36:19.896 --> 00:36:20.416
Come on.

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:22.896
No.

00:36:24.095 --> 00:36:25.736
Wait. They hired me.

00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:27.015
Who?

00:36:28.015 --> 00:36:29.215
Her boyfriend.

00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:32.296
He hired you to stalk her?

00:36:33.095 --> 00:36:33.615
No.

00:36:34.215 --> 00:36:35.856
He hired me to drug her

00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.015
and then sleep with her.

00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:42.575
Explain this.

00:36:43.296 --> 00:36:44.095
Explain yourself.

00:36:45.175 --> 00:36:45.695
Well,

00:36:47.095 --> 00:36:49.095
I don't know what he wanted.

00:36:50.055 --> 00:36:51.535
He timed everything precisely.

00:36:51.535 --> 00:36:53.055
He made me do it during her ovulation.

00:36:53.976 --> 00:36:55.055
If she got pregnant,

00:36:55.856 --> 00:36:56.936
there'd be extra payment.

00:36:57.535 --> 00:36:58.655
If it failed,

00:37:00.256 --> 00:37:01.695
I'd try again next month.

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.456
Listen up.

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:12.896
I have your photo

00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:14.376
and know who hired you.

00:37:14.655 --> 00:37:16.495
If I see you again,

00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:18.776
you'll lose this arm.

00:37:19.296 --> 00:37:20.135
Understood?

00:37:21.896 --> 00:37:22.736
Yes.

00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:23.456
Get lost.

00:37:39.336 --> 00:37:40.575
Ms. Lin wants to see you.

00:38:04.256 --> 00:38:05.776
Sis, prepare some late-night snacks.

00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:07.015
Yes, Ms. Lin.

00:38:07.175 --> 00:38:09.296
Lin Ling, sit with Dr. Lv
and have a bite.

00:38:09.976 --> 00:38:11.816
He's worked hard all night.

00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:13.896
It's nothing.

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.175
No trouble at all.

00:38:15.495 --> 00:38:16.776
Don't bother this late.

00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:17.816
I'm heading back.

00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:28.856
Right.

00:38:30.215 --> 00:38:32.055
Well, a quick bite won't hurt.

00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:34.416
As they say,
a horse needs its midnight boats.

00:38:35.456 --> 00:38:36.976
I mean, oats.

00:38:45.816 --> 00:38:46.776
Okay, Ms. Lin.

00:38:47.736 --> 00:38:49.575
Sis, take them over first.

00:38:49.776 --> 00:38:50.976
Clean up here later.

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:51.896
Okay.

00:38:52.535 --> 00:38:53.376
Xiong Hei's here.

00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:54.936
He's waiting downstairs.

00:38:55.055 --> 00:38:55.615
Okay.

00:39:21.816 --> 00:39:22.896
This tea's pretty good.

00:39:23.495 --> 00:39:24.336
The aroma's amazing.

00:39:30.175 --> 00:39:31.256
Don't you think

00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.856
your moxibustion smell

00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:35.256
is even stronger?

00:39:37.256 --> 00:39:38.055
My apologies.

00:39:38.495 --> 00:39:40.135
Can't help it. That room's stuffy.

00:39:40.816 --> 00:39:42.655
True, I did the moxa treatment
longer today.

00:39:43.856 --> 00:39:44.655
It's okay.

00:39:46.135 --> 00:39:47.896
I actually like medicinal smells.

00:39:48.256 --> 00:39:48.856
Really?

00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:52.896
What about paint smell?

00:39:53.736 --> 00:39:55.015
That's nice too.

00:39:55.856 --> 00:39:58.456
Those slightly weird odors,

00:39:59.256 --> 00:40:03.256
like nail polish or exhaust fumes.

00:40:03.456 --> 00:40:04.615
Wait, let me guess.

00:40:07.816 --> 00:40:09.695
Damp stairwell after rain?

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:12.615
Sun-baked bedding?

00:40:14.615 --> 00:40:16.456
Snapped celery stalks?

00:40:17.095 --> 00:40:18.055
Mildewed rags?

00:40:18.336 --> 00:40:19.456
Squashed stink bugs?

00:40:23.575 --> 00:40:25.336
Find out who did it by tomorrow.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.175
Working on it.

00:40:26.296 --> 00:40:27.615
Sis, I'm heading out.

00:40:30.575 --> 00:40:31.175
Okay.

00:40:52.615 --> 00:40:54.376
(Legend says in Xingbazi Town)

00:40:54.376 --> 00:40:55.776
(there's a great swamp)

00:40:55.776 --> 00:40:57.175
(that is so creepy.)

00:40:57.336 --> 00:40:59.344
Just as we suspected.

00:40:59.344 --> 00:41:01.215
(Big Brother
carried mountain goods to market)

00:41:01.215 --> 00:41:02.736
(and pass through this swamp.)

00:41:02.736 --> 00:41:03.615
Direct lineage.

00:41:04.376 --> 00:41:05.296
Close kin.

00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:07.135
(Following his brother's steps...)

00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:08.135
Now it makes sense

00:41:08.135 --> 00:41:09.296
why Chen Fu went

00:41:09.296 --> 00:41:10.695
to such lengths in his attempt

00:41:10.736 --> 00:41:11.896
to get Xu Anni pregnant.

00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:18.095
That's why Lin Xirou
has been controlling Lin Ling

00:41:18.655 --> 00:41:19.695
and forcing her to marry.

00:41:19.695 --> 00:41:20.336
Exactly.

00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:22.095
Lin Ling is her blood bag.

00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:23.416
Once Lin Ling has offspring,

00:41:23.416 --> 00:41:24.695
she loses her value.

00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:25.896
She could be in danger.

00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.416
When Lin Xirou first showed up,

00:41:27.416 --> 00:41:28.896
Lin Ling wasn't born, right?

00:41:31.776 --> 00:41:32.856
She was adopted later.

00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:37.456
So that means

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:39.936
before Lin Ling came,

00:41:40.095 --> 00:41:41.655
a close kin of hers

00:41:42.296 --> 00:41:43.816
was already Lin Xirou's blood bag.

00:42:08.256 --> 00:42:09.575
It was definitely sabotaged.
