[Adapted from the novel "My Queen" by Xie Lounan]

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
[Episode 25]

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.690
You may go.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.050
I don't like you.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.900
It's fine if Your Highness doesn't care for me.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.900
But before Commander Li left,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.850
he asked me to bring you a message.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.460
Would you like to hear it?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.850
What is it?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.250
Commander Li told me to remind you that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.540
as long as you keep calm,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.330
don't hit anyone,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.540
and behave yourself,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.660
the flower

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.380
will soon be in bloom.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.210
That's not right.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.660
Your Highness.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.410
That is indeed Commander Li's message.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.770
What's wrong with it?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.130
You didn't say it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.420
as nicely as he did.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.180
Then, Your Highness,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.900
about this meal...

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.810
I'll behave.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.180
I'll eat it.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890
Her Majesty arrives!

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.390
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.330
What brings you here?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.980
I came out for some air,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.650
and thought I'd stop by to check on you.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.770
I'm here now.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.700
Dismissed.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.810
Yes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.570
I know why you've come.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.060
You were afraid I'd be angry.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.690
Don't worry.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.410
I was a little angry just now,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.340
but I've already forgiven you.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.890
Forgiven us?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.780
Why?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.130
It's a secret.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.260
I'm not telling you.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.010
It seems our Princess Ying has

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.500
grown more poised and gracious,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.500
and far more considerate.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.890
When will Hongqing be able to return?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.220
Well, I don't know either.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.570
However,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.690
I believe that as long as you behave,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.130
and wait for Commander Li's return,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.570
His Majesty will surely have a surprise for you.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.570
All right.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.570
I'll trust you.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.340
Of course you should trust me.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.220
Oh, Your Majesty,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.850
if I receive a gift from Hongqing,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.260
shouldn't I send one in return?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.130
Naturally.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.570
What gift in this world is the best?

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.690
In this world,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.980
there is no such thing as the "best" gift.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.940
As long as your heart is in it,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.500
that makes it the best.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.570
My heart...

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.170
Does it mean

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.820
a gift made with my own hands would be better?

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.690
Yes.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.730
I know what I want to give him.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.260
So,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.980
Princess Ying summoned

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.260
the palace maid who sent Li Hongqing that sachet,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.290
and she could learn how to make one herself.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.540
Yes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.110
My younger sister has always held grudges.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.790
It is no small feat for her

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920
to come this far.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.170
Indeed.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.730
I wonder if things are going smoothly on Li Hongqing's side.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.930
Hongqing has always been meticulous.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.340
Put your mind at ease.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.340
I just hope they all return safely.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.810
But truth be told,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.280
this sachet is quite ugly.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.410
Actually, Princess Ying hasn't finished

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.810
making the sachet she intends for Li Hongqing.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.900
This is the one

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.460
I made for Your Majesty.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.200
I came to ask what kind of fragrance

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.630
you'd prefer.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.370
But since Your Majesty dislikes it,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.230
then I'll take it back.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.490
Why would I dislike it?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.250
I only glanced at it and missed the details.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.460
With a closer look,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.900
your hands are as skilled as ever.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.810
Your stitching could rival the palace embroiderers.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.170
Do you mean that?

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.020
Of course.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.140
I...

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.540
I like it a great deal.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.170
Glad to hear that.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.220
Our little princess

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.700
has given her heart

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.020
to Li Hongqing,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.730
and is still waiting for the flower to bloom.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.250
And yet,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.290
will she be met with joy or grief?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.540
What are you getting at?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.220
Working with that man

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.700
is like playing with fire.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.340
To him, you are nothing

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.930
but a piece on the board.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.930
So,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.140
does that trouble you?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.020
A piece can be played

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.140
or tossed aside.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.140
Madam, all I want is for you

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.170
to live freely, without chains,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.340
not bound to anyone's will.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.610
I know what you're saying.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.020
But there's something important

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.140
I need to tell you.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.490
What is it?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.930
The important thing

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.700
is that you're still calling me "Madam."

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.140
I...

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.410
I'm simply used to it.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.140
It's hard to change this habit.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.580
Very well.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.540
Suit yourself.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.580
Some incense

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.140
can quiet the mind, soothe the spirit.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.900
Others

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.250
can steal a life without a sound.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.490
Do you think the Lingbi Sect

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.610
is capable of taking Li Hongqing's life?

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.180
Help him.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.650
Yes.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.490
It's a trap.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.650
Go!

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.770
Go on ahead.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.700
Quit talking.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.580
You're Li Hongqing.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.180
And what of it?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.490
I've been expecting you!

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.060
It's you!

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.730
Save it,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.490
just move!

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.730
There are too many pursuers.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.340
We need a distraction.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.890
Luo Xianxue,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.370
I'm entrusting Shi Yan to you.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.180
Why trust me?

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.940
You chose to save us.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.060
You'd already made your decision.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.180
Get him out of here.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.370
Head for the Capital.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.530
Tell His Majesty and the Empress

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.820
about the Lingbi Sect.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.340
Don't worry.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.130
I won't die.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.340
Someone is waiting for my return.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.490
Be careful.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.700
When it blooms,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.650
we'll wander

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.250
through mountains and rivers

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.250
to see the sea of blossoms.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.300
Your Highness.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.490
Is there news of Hongqing?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.770
Your Highness,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.580
your dinner from the Imperial Kitchens.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.220
Hongqing said

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.180
I mustn't bully the weak.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.700
Otherwise, he wouldn't like me anymore.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.420
Then,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.530
allow me to help Your Highness dine.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.530
I'm not eating.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.850
I'm going to His Majesty.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.100
You are not to follow me.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.700
Your Majesty!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.730
Your Majesty!

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.460
Your Majesty!

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.530
What now?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.370
This is...

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.010
Li Hongqing's sword.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.370
To save General Shi Yan,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.490
Commander Li lured the Lingbi Sect's elites away

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.250
and fell off the cliff to his death.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.010
What?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.850
Did they recover his body?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.850
They searched for two full days and nights.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.610
All they found was his sword.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.180
How could this be...

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.850
General Shi Yan said

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.580
the Lingbi Sect seemed prepared from the start.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.770
They set up an ambush.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.180
If not for Luo Xianxue,

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.290
they would've

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.330
all died there.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.530
Luo Xianxue...

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.060
Shi Yan must not give up.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.060
He must keep searching for Li Hongqing.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.530
As long as there is no body,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.420
Li Hongqing isn't dead yet.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.580
Yes.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.340
Wait.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.130
Princess Ying

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.250
must never find out.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.240
Yes.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.370
What can't I know?

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.850
I heard everything.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.010
Is Hongqing dead?

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.010
Xiao Ying...

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.250
Listen to me.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.130
Did you send Hongqing out there?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.580
You never liked him, so you sent him away on purpose.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.180
You just wanted him gone!

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.340
That's not true.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.490
Don't touch me!

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.420
You're the one who killed him.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.890
I will never

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.460
forgive you!

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.300
Your Highness!

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.610
Your Majesty,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.850
what should we do?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.700
When she loses her temper,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.500
there's no telling what she'll do.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.180
Summon

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.850
the Prince of Yuzhang here.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.460
As you wish.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.730
- Princess Ying! - Princess Ying!

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.770
- Your Highness. - Princess Ying!

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.610
Where is the princess?

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.300
Princess Ying!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.300
- Your Highness, - Princess Ying!

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.610
Princess Ying returned an hour ago.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.010
She looked terribly upset.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.420
And then she vanished.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.170
A bunch of fools.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:14.670
Princess Ying!

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.180
- Search over there with me! - Yes!

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.420
Princess Ying!

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.000
This way!

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.150
You, search there!

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.060
Princess Ying!

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.340
Princess Ying, where are you?

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.130
Ying.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.490
Ying.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.860
Ying.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.290
What kind of flower is this?

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.250
Let me see it, will you?

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:14.380
Qianqing.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.250
Come.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.730
Ying.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.050
It's all right.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.940
I will plant it for you.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.530
I promise it'll be just the same.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.730
It will bloom, I swear.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.980
I can't get angry.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.380
I can't hit or scold anyone.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.530
Or else Hongqing won't like me anymore.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.010
Ying, stop it.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.770
I can't get angry.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.140
I can't hit or scold anyone.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.730
Or else Hongqing won't like me anymore.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.700
But I can't hold it in. What do I do?

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.090
Get out!

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.140
I want you to leave!

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.660
I can't get angry.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.050
I mustn't get angry.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.250
If I get angry,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.420
the flower won't bloom.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.380
I can't get angry.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.050
I mustn't get angry.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.570
If I get angry,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.770
the flower won't bloom.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.490
I can't get angry...

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.770
Li Hongqing isn't coming back.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.580
You and Li Hongqing bought tanghulu in the market.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.530
He bought this pot of flowers for you.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.870
It's actually a Blaze Blossom.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.460
When it blooms, it's brilliant.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.980
A symbol of freedom.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.530
He hoped you'd always live happy and unbound.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.180
He put his heart into everything he did for you.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.250
Stop talking.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.140
I'm not angry.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.570
I can't get angry.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.570
I mustn't get angry.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.420
You've tended to this flower so carefully,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.550
waiting for it to bloom,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.220
hoping he'd see it when he came back.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.140
Isn't that right?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.770
If I get angry, Hongqing won't like me anymore.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.810
I can't be angry.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.420
Li Hongqing is dead.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.090
Even if the flower blooms,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.180
there's no one left to cherish you.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.290
You're lying!

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.290
Hongqing won't die.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.810
He won't.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.660
He's dead.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.700
And it was His Majesty who killed him.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.330
- I didn't think anything of the sort... - You want to kill him.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.660
Stop talking.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.090
- Be quiet. - You want to kill him.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.810
- I wasn't thinking that! - Kill him.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.010
Kill him!

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.010
Kill His Majesty!

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.330
Avenge your dear Hongqing!

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.860
Kill His Majesty!

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.180
Avenge your dear Hongqing!

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.730
I'm going to kill him.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.810
He must die.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.090
I must avenge Hongqing.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.290
I must kill him.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.700
I thought Your Majesty

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.250
was about to remove the cloak

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.940
and drape it over me.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.490
Why haven't you returned home?

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.460
Worried about Ying?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.660
Lately,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.010
my right eyelid keeps twitching.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.490
Something isn't sitting right in my heart.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.980
This is the only jug of wine I have left.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.330
I was hoping it'd last me till morning.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.380
Don't be late

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.090
for tomorrow's court session.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.980
Minister Xing will be presenting the waterworks funding proposal.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.810
I'll need your support.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.790
Do you intend to work me to the bone,

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.090
and have me serve till death?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.760
It's for the sake of Great Qi.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.010
Here, Prince of Yuzhang.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.050
You've done well.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.290
I only have one younger sister.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.460
She may be a little wild,

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.220
but she's the apple of my eye.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.140
I understand.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.940
I haven't given up on Li Hongqing.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.490
I believe

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.700
he won't meet his demise so easily.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.570
Wufu.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.330
Yes.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.250
Prepare a brazier for the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.010
At once.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.620
Ying.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.460
Why won't you come in?

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.570
I wouldn't dare.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.290
You said no one was allowed inside.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.730
I couldn't bear the consequences

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.770
of invoking your anger.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.860
I'm fine now.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.420
Truly?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.320
Ying.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.010
I promise you

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.770
that Li Hongqing will be all right.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.250
And the flower will bloom.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.490
Ying,

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.620
you'll have happiness in life.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.220
Yes.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.250
The Blaze Blossom

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.980
will bloom.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.460
You...

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.220
You know what flower it is now?

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.900
Princess Ying is preparing to awaken the Dual-Pupil Art?

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.620
Yes.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.940
I've heard

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.050
that art exists only in legends.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.250
Everything is progressing as planned.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.250
The Dual-Pupil Art is terrifyingly powerful,

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.700
and Princess Ying is now

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.700
slowly losing her sanity.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.900
She's ready to drag him down with her if she must.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.980
These past days,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.660
I've tampered

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.220
with His Majesty's pills.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.330
Just enough to leave him drowsy,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.220
and none the wiser.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.420
But tell me,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.050
has Princess Ying ever seen your true face?

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.860
She shouldn't recognize me.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.490
These next few days,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.380
I'll keep a close watch on her.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.460
[Poison Toad]

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.900
[Devoid of Delusion]

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.330
Sir.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.090
Everything is prepared.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.900
Are you certain

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.410
this will cure me?

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.860
Madam has said

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.730
she'd rid you of your suffering once and for all.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.620
Very well.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.550
Let's begin.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.220
Yes, sir.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.010
You're awake.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.570
How long was I asleep?

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.700
An hour.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.770
Your Majesty has been overworked lately.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.860
It's normal to be drowsy now and then.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.010
You summoned Mr. Li Chengtian.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.660
He'll be here shortly.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.940
I'll fetch some Zixue Pills

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.090
to help you stay alert.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.010
All right.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:54.140
You don't know where Princess Ying has gone?

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.330
Her Majesty had chicken soup prepared for her.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.730
It won't taste good once it's cold.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.530
I really don't know.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.940
Lately, the princess has stayed in her chamber.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.290
No one is allowed in.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.490
But today, for some reason, she's not there.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.050
We're searching as well.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.290
It's fine.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.570
We'll wait for her in her chamber, then.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.530
She'll return eventually.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.770
Your Majesty,

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.940
the princess forbids lighting a fire inside.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.050
It's a bit cold within.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.090
It's all right.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.900
Your Majesty.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.700
Ying.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.860
Ying.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.250
Why are you here?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.660
Did you find Hongqing?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.530
Not yet.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.490
But I haven't given up.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.250
The fact that we haven't found his body

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.490
also proves

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.220
that Li Hongqing is still alive.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.530
You're lying to me.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.330
I'm not.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.090
Is it because

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.770
you hate seeing me in love with Hongqing?

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.250
Did you send him to his death?

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.570
Did you want him dead?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.490
I did not.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.140
Why would I do such a thing?

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.090
You've never liked me since we were children.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.860
You wanted me dead.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.140
You wanted the fire to burn me alive.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.620
Ying, calm down.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.940
Do not call me that!

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.490
Only Hongqing can call me that.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.230
Shall I summon the Prince of Yuzhang?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.530
Believe me or not,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.880
I am your brother as well.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.830
I want you to be happy too.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.900
And I hope that one day

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.700
you'll let me care for you.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.860
If Your Majesty truly cares for me...

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.490
Promise me one thing,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.530
will you?

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.810
Certainly.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.290
Tell me.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.330
Look at this table. It's so messy, and no one cleaned it.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.530
These servants all deserve a beating.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.660
Judging by this sight,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.050
the princess hasn't slept in her bed

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.460
for quite some time.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.090
The eunuchs said

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.860
she'd barely eaten these days.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.660
She stopped eating and sleeping over Li Hongqing.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.140
If this goes on,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.290
it will take a toll on her body.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.290
And who knows what she does

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.810
when shut up in here all day.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.090
Something here has been moved.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.490
Why would she shift the carpet?

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.250
Your Majesty!

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.620
The figure wearing the crown

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.250
is

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.490
His Majesty?

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:10.290
Guards!

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.900
Your Majesty.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.090
Where is His Majesty now?

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.330
Likely in Wuying Hall.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.250
Notify General Lu.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:17.980
Deliver my decree.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.010
Summon the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.530
The rest of you, come with me to Wuying Hall.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.220
Yes.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.250
Your Majesty!

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.900
It's alright.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.900
Just die,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.940
all right?

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.570
Die!

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.380
Your Majesty!

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.770
Princess Ying!

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.420
Stop at once!

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.530
- General Lu! - General Lu!

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.050
- Are you injured? - General Lu!

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.460
Don't come any closer!

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.530
The Empress?

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.330
I think I might like you a little.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.050
Forgive me.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.460
He's the one Li Hongqing loved and respected most!

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.140
No.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.980
The one he loved most was me.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.380
He's followed His Majesty since he was nine.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.250
If you kill him,

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.900
Li Hongqing will never forgive you!

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.860
Xiao Ying.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.490
Do you still remember

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.420
what Li Hongqing promised you?

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.260
If you wish,

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.690
I'll take you out of the palace

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.980
to see the sea of blossoms.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.690
If I wish,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.300
he'll take me to see the flowers.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.530
That's right.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.340
He promised you

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.010
you'd see the flowers.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.490
But if you kill His Majesty now,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.610
that wish will never come true.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.980
Liar.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.130
I'm not lying.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.130
If Li Hongqing stood here today,

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.260
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.900
If you kill the one he respects most,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.820
then you will never

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.780
see him again.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.340
Shut up!

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.050
Your Majesty.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.490
Are you all right?

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.460
Cangcang...

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:57.980
Cangcang!

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.650
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.700
[Wuying Hall]

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.260
Your Highness.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.090
Ying.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:14.900
Ying!

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.740
Ying!

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.490
Ying, are you hurt?

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.690
Ying?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.420
Ying.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.860
Why would you do this?

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.900
Tell me.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.860
Why did you do this?

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.300
And His Majesty?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.210
How is he?

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.420
Your Highness,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.650
His Majesty is safe.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.690
However,

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.880
Her Majesty...

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.860
I deserve punishment.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.050
Nothing would atone for this.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.010
Where are they?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.380
Sent to Linghe Hall.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.860
Imperial Physician Li is there.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.820
Eunuch Feng and the others

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.570
were likely struck by Ying's Enfeebling Dust.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.460
The cold palace should have the antidote.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.340
One more thing.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.090
If the Empress Dowager arrives,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.130
you must stop her.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.260
Do not let her near Linghe Hall.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.130
Yes.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.610
You brat.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.050
Get some rest.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.900
When will the Empress be out of danger?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.490
Her Majesty miscarried and lost too much blood.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.260
But her constitution is strong.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.570
If she wakes, she should recover.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.210
And if she doesn't wake?

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.740
You brat.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.460
You must keep a clear head.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.090
A clear head?

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.300
My child is gone.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.420
My empress remains unconscious.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.610
How do you expect me to be calm?

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.940
Now,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.860
my child is gone.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.570
The Empress is bleeding out, clinging to life.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.210
All thanks to your dear little sister.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:21.900
I deserve

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.690
a thousand deaths.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.570
You need not die.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.130
But Xiao Ying

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.690
must pay the price.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.780
It's my fault for failing to guide her.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.980
Punish me instead.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.340
Will you die in her place too?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.980
Your Majesty, I beg you.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.940
