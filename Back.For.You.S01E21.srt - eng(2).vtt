kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.080
Yeah.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.480
Go on.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.000
We parked the car at Jianshe Community's gate.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640
Then Ren Nan woke up.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.160
He saw where we were.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.840
He got anxious.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.520
He asked why we came here.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.680
Then he glanced at me.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.400
I understood right away.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.920
I asked, "Is this your girlfriend's place?"

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.440
He didn't say much.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.920
He just asked me to keep it secret.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.520
I just thought,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.600
so I took it as a yes.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.960
Does she have a boyfriend?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.280
She often stays in her room

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.680
talking on the phone with someone.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.520
Sounds like it's her boyfriend.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.360
Sometimes she gets pretty mad.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.640
Did he ever mention

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.000
his girlfriend's name?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.400
You're funny.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.040
If I ask, would he even tell me?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.560
Bro.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.440
What's wrong?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.760
Jianshe Community was Su Ruo's home.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.440
Because of the college entrance exam,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
I have to say goodbye for now.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.520
But the radio station will always be with you.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.400
Youth doesn't fade,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
and friendship even less so.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960
I'm Su Ruo.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.680
Good night, everyone.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.800
Bro.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280
That Zhang Xun is pretty fun.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.240
He keeps chatting with me since adding me on WeChat.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.920
Bro.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.320
Are you still

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.080
obsessed with Su Ruo's cause of death?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.880
Can't let it go?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.720
I can't really say.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.720
Even though

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.600
it's been fifteen years,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.280
to me,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.960
it feels like it happened just yesterday.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.200
No matter the outcome,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.560
at least we tried.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.000
Whatever the ending,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.520
we'll face it together.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.480
Even if I can't do anything,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.880
these wonderful memories

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.160
can make her happy.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.320
I had accepted

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.640
that Su Ruo's death was just an accident.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.400
But Zhang Xun just gave me a clue.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400
I realized

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.480
I'm still not satisfied.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.520
What does this really mean?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.120
So how did Su Ruo really die?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.640
Bro,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.640
do you want

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400
to find out the truth for her,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.880
or do you just wish

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.360
she were alive?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.840
I don't know.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.640
Maybe I just

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.040
can't do either.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.440
Maybe all these years,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.720
I've been fighting myself.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.000
It's just me not letting go.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.880
As long as there's a chance to try,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.560
give it another shot.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.520
It's okay even if you can't do it.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
Didn't you just say

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.160
maybe you just can't forgive yourself?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.080
Then give it your all and try again.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.600
That's the only way to avoid regrets.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.240
You're right.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.560
Sorry.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.600
THE USER YOU CALLED IS UNAVAILABLE.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.200
PLEASE CALL AGAIN LATER.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.320
Hello?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.320
Is this Ren Nan?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.320
Who are you?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.560
I'm Ren Nan's high school classmate.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.080
I...

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.120
Hello?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.320
Hello?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.840
Hello, how can I help you?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.160
Is Ren Nan available?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.480
Do you have an appointment?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.800
I'm his high school classmate.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.680
My name is Yu Xingchen.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.120
Director Ren is out on business.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.280
He's not at the office now.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.280
Please let him know

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.600
a classmate came to see him.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.840
Okay, sir.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.960
Where's Ren Nan?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.840
Do you have an appointment?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.160
Appointment?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.520
Yes.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.720
Di Ge, you're here.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.400
Director Ren really isn't here today.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.960
Di Ge.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.680
Di Ge, listen to me, Di Ge.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.680
Wait for me!

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.960
Everyone has a high school era.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.160
Men, I get it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.600
But if Director Ren is still so sentimental and loyal,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.000
and rekindles things with those

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.480
riff-raff from high school or college,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
it doesn't suit Director Ren's status,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.240
and it's bad for our companies' partnership.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.720
Go tell my future brother-in-law

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.520
we'll be family soon.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.800
Don't do anything to hurt my sister again.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.440
I'll be sure to tell him.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.640
Tired of living?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.720
Sorry.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.040
I was just in the garage

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.560
and overheard you talking to Director Ren's secretary.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.280
I'm Director Ren's high school classmate.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.840
I heard you say

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.840
Director Ren rekindled things with a high school classmate.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.280
Is that classmate named Su Ruo?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.160
That woman is something else.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.240
Making Ren Nan bewitched isn't enough,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.880
now another fool shows up.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.400
It really is Su Ruo.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.760
Drive.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.080
I want to check the community's footage from that night.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.040
I've seen the footage.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.920
What did you find?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.280
Is Ren Nan here?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.320
If we can find

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.480
direct evidence Ren Nan was on the rooftop that night,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.760
even if he wasn't Su Ruo's boyfriend,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.480
even if he was just a delivery guy,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.600
I'll still bring him in for questioning.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.880
You've done your best.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.480
My team has a task.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.760
I'll be there soon.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.360
How is he doing now?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.840
I just went upstairs to check.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.920
But he still hasn't woken up.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.040
My advice is to wait here for now.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.640
If Lao Jiang regains consciousness,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.560
then we'll go up.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.560
His family has already contacted me.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.280
They asked if we could prepare things in advance.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.880
What could I say to that?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.160
You can't book a funeral home ahead of time.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.360
All I could say was, "Don't worry."

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.120
It'll be fine.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.680
Ren Nan's car.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.920
Are you sure?

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.920
I've ridden in it before.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.160
I messaged Ren Nan in our group.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.000
But he hasn't replied to me.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.160
I believe he'll definitely come.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.680
Back then, his dad caught him secretly taking the art exam.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.160
They had a huge argument.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.360
Luckily, Lao Jiang mediated between them.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.680
That's why he didn't run away from home.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.880
So I say he and Lao Jiang are close.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.480
Where is he?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.680
Where is he?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.120
He's awake.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.360
Lao Jiang, how are you feeling?

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.240
You are...

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.080
It's fine. If you can't remember, don't force it.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.080
Just like when I tried to memorize texts.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.080
I remember.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.400
Let me think.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.400
Even Lao Jiang forgets things sometimes.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.640
You're not that young anymore.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.560
Why are you still dressed so casually?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.040
Should I wear my school uniform to see you?

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.960
That's fine too.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.560
Looks like you remember who I am.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.280
Mr. Jiang, we've come to see you.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.640
You have a conscience.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.920
Everyone's here.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.760
Of course.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.880
Back then...

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.760
You scolded me every day.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.760
I let bygones be bygones and still came.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.760
That's loyal, right?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.440
Darn it, I'll go get some water.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.000
Can you check the samples for me again?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.040
Maybe we can find

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.480
a new treatment plan.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.360
Thank you, goodbye.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.600
When did you get here?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.440
Not long ago.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.240
Why aren't you going in?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.120
I'm on the phone with an overseas cancer expert.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.800
Checking on the teacher's condition.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.360
Have you read any crime books lately?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.560
Stop beating around the bush.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.080
Just ask what you want to know.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.520
So you think

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.800
I shouldn't suspect an old classmate?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.560
This has nothing to do with friendship.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.400
It's only about logic and motive.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.760
According to you,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.240
If it were me,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.800
I'd suspect Ren Nan too.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
You suspect Ren Nan

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.680
because he and Su Ruo

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.800
might have been in a relationship.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.240
But such a simple relationship check,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.520
would the police miss it?

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.720
They probably checked long ago.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.960
Tang Song explained it clearly to you.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.520
You just didn't understand it yourself.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.920
What did Tang Song say to me?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.040
You said it yourself.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.800
Tang Song told you

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.440
as long as you can find direct evidence

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.800
that Ren Nan was at Jianshe Community that night,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.920
I can take him in for questioning.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.960
What does that mean?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.920
He didn't deny your suspicion.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.960
Isn't that basically confirming it?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.400
Ren Nan and Su Ruo's relationship?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.240
Later you said Ren Nan wasn't on the footage.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
I think this matter

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.880
the police probably checked long ago.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.800
With the current evidence,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.200
it's not enough for the police to take Ren Nan in.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.520
Yu Xingchen.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.640
Try solving it from another angle.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.040
In my opinion,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.480
Ren Nan may not have been at the scene,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.200
but he's still connected to Su Ruo's death.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.840
He can't be separated from it.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.520
What do you mean?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.240
Ren Nan came today.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.560
His car is downstairs.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.840
But he didn't come up.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.200
Why?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.760
You went to his company two days ago.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.040
He definitely knows.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.360
Then he stopped answering your calls.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.440
Hung up on you.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.880
He's just avoiding you.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.320
If someone has nothing to hide,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.960
they can just explain.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.400
Why avoid you?
