00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.992
=Episode 15=

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.994
When Lin Xirou first showed up,

00:01:56.753 --> 00:01:58.074
Lin Ling wasn't born, right?

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.313
She was adopted later.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:02.673
So that means

00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:04.954
before Lin Ling came,

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.714
a close kin of hers

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.754
was already Lin Xirou's blood bag.

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:22.568
(Roadsound Mining)

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:23.794
Madam.

00:02:24.673 --> 00:02:25.354
Come in.

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:27.713
Yan Tuo, do you know me?

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:28.333
Yan Tuo.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:28.993
Good boy.

00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:29.754
You're so tall.

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:30.914
Hello, Madam.

00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:32.553
Hello, Madam.

00:02:32.713 --> 00:02:33.393
Hello, Madam.

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:34.673
Hello, Madam.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:35.794
Hello, Madam.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.873
Mom, are you tired?

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.234
Let me support you.

00:02:44.553 --> 00:02:45.433
I'm not tired.

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:46.673
Thank you, Tuo.

00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:53.194
Hello, Madam.

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:54.713
Let me feel your face.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.113
Get lost, you.

00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:21.776
Hello, Madam.

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:24.814
Hello, Madam.

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:25.993
Tuo, your homework?

00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:27.074
No homework today.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.634
Tuo! You came to see me?

00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:31.433
Quick. Let me hold you.

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:33.593
Quite heavy.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.273
I missed you so much.

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:39.433
Tell me,

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:40.273
did you miss me?

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:43.273
You two never act proper when meeting.

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.234
How's this improper?

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:45.993
If you ask me,

00:03:46.034 --> 00:03:47.314
you're the improper one.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:48.833
Waddling around

00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:49.914
with this huge belly.

00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:51.194
The doctor said

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:52.514
I need to stay active.

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:53.754
Alright.

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:54.993
Haven't eaten yet?

00:03:54.993 --> 00:03:55.553
Not yet.

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:56.673
Here.

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:57.393
What's the treat?

00:03:58.593 --> 00:03:59.234
Dumplings.

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:01.354
How'd you know I was craving these?

00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:02.954
Eat while they're hot.

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:03.794
Okay.

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:08.673
Here, Tuo, try this.

00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:09.634
See if it's good.

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:11.433
Mom should eat too.

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:12.754
Okay, give Mom some.

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:14.234
I've eaten. You eat.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.034
You have?

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:15.954
Let me taste.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:20.314
Good?

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.233
Delicious.

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:23.393
Something's happened! Get help!

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:24.874
Yan, something's wrong.

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:25.554
Madam.

00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:26.314
What happened?

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.593
Hard to explain. Yan, maybe you...

00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.074
Alright. I'll check it out.

00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:32.393
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:38.514
What's wrong? What happened?

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:40.593
You'd better see for yourself.

00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:44.033
(That time,)

00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:45.393
(a worker at my dad's mine)

00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:46.634
(caused trouble)

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:47.833
and hid in the mine.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.353
Later my dad
took many men down to search

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:52.194
but never found him.

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:53.913
I still remember his name.

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:54.954
Li Ergou.

00:04:56.434 --> 00:04:57.353
Not long after,

00:04:57.353 --> 00:04:58.754
Lin Xirou came to our family.

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:00.314
My dad said

00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:02.393
she was Li Ergou's cousin.

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.593
So you think Li Ergou

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.434
was Lin Xirou's original blood bag?

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:11.833
Yes.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.033
If so,

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:16.314
he was also Lin Ling's close kin.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:19.874
However,

00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:23.114
Li Ergou was very young
when he disappeared,

00:05:23.713 --> 00:05:25.473
so he definitely wasn't her dad.

00:05:29.273 --> 00:05:30.393
Regardless of the relation,

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:32.353
Lin Ling is like you.

00:05:32.954 --> 00:05:35.153
Both of your families
were destroyed by Lin Xirou.

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:37.194
Moreover,

00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:40.393
you've kept treating her as family.

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:50.233
But... even if unhappy,

00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:52.393
at least she's alive and well.

00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:55.233
As for my sister Yan Xin,

00:05:57.233 --> 00:05:58.634
there's been no news at all.

00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:36.074
Still worried about Xu Anni?

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:40.273
That man
should've stopped following her.

00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:42.194
I'm thinking

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:45.194
about how I should pretend to be Chen Fu

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:46.233
and break up with her.

00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:52.954
I read the messages
Xu Anni sent Chen Fu.

00:06:53.554 --> 00:06:54.754
She's deeply reliant on him.

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:56.954
I'm afraid his disappearance

00:06:57.074 --> 00:06:58.194
will break her.

00:06:58.874 --> 00:07:00.233
I need to at least make up a lie

00:07:00.393 --> 00:07:01.833
so she can move on with her life.

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:12.833
Well,

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:16.114
humanoid Earth Fiends
and their roommates

00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:17.473
have such close relationships.

00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:20.233
If humans get injured by Earth Fiends,

00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:22.314
wouldn't they get infected?

00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:29.634
I've fought with Xiong Hei,
Han Guan, and Chen Fu

00:07:29.634 --> 00:07:31.033
and sustained injuries.

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:32.473
I didn't use natural fire,

00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:33.634
yet I wasn't infected.

00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:35.233
Humanoid Earth Fiends

00:07:35.353 --> 00:07:37.314
can already mask their scent.

00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:39.634
Their ability to infect humans

00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:41.153
must have weakened too.

00:07:42.153 --> 00:07:43.153
That makes sense.

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:53.874
You handle it.

00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:54.994
What?

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:56.554
Send the message to Xu Anni.

00:07:56.713 --> 00:07:58.273
Aren't you good at this sort of thing?

00:07:58.954 --> 00:07:59.713
Why?

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:01.233
Play around casually

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:03.074
and dump girls with flimsy excuses.

00:08:03.273 --> 00:08:04.833
Shouldn't this be your specialty?

00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:05.674
H-Hold on.

00:08:06.273 --> 00:08:08.713
As a modern independent female artist,

00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:10.434
why are you so prejudiced against men?

00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:12.074
Hurry up and help me.

00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:20.194
Alright.

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:21.153
Write like this.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:25.153
During this business trip,

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:29.473
I've calmly reassessed my life

00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:31.833
and made new plans.

00:08:32.794 --> 00:08:33.794
But I realized

00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:35.233
you're not part of them.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.713
This is unfair to you.

00:08:39.794 --> 00:08:41.394
I don't want to hold you back.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:44.154
You deserve better opportunities

00:08:44.154 --> 00:08:45.633
and broader horizons.

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:47.154
That's it.

00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:52.113
Just as I thought.

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:53.274
What?

00:08:53.513 --> 00:08:54.593
You told me to say it.

00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:55.593
Fine.

00:08:55.713 --> 00:08:57.154
Say it again, slower this time.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:00.513
What was it?

00:09:00.593 --> 00:09:02.233
During this business trip...

00:09:02.753 --> 00:09:03.394
Business trip.

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:05.154
During this business trip,

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:07.074
I've calmly reassessed my...

00:09:16.713 --> 00:09:18.034
The courtyard is well-maintained.

00:09:18.794 --> 00:09:20.113
It's not your first time here.

00:09:20.674 --> 00:09:21.513
Just noticed now?

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.034
Last time...

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:25.633
You came sneaking around last time

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:26.873
and left in a hurry.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.113
You didn't have time for it.

00:09:28.794 --> 00:09:30.194
No need to be so sarcastic.

00:09:31.674 --> 00:09:32.394
Ms. Lu.

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:33.674
Miss Nie.

00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:35.713
You've finally returned.

00:09:37.554 --> 00:09:38.394
What happened to you?

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:42.034
I went to Tuofeng Mountain earlier

00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:43.473
to photograph cliff carvings.

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:44.914
I lost my footing and fell.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:46.833
Luckily, Mr. Yan here got me

00:09:46.873 --> 00:09:48.074
to the hospital in time.

00:09:48.314 --> 00:09:50.194
I didn't tell you to avoid worrying you.

00:09:50.713 --> 00:09:51.873
Was it serious?

00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:53.914
Almost recovered now.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:55.993
Thank you.

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:57.194
No need for thanks.

00:09:57.473 --> 00:09:58.233
You must be hungry.

00:09:58.233 --> 00:09:59.314
I'll make something.

00:09:59.434 --> 00:10:00.513
We were waiting for that.

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:01.873
Come inside quickly.

00:10:01.993 --> 00:10:02.833
Sorry to trouble you.

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:04.554
So you're Mr. Yan?

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:05.993
You're both kind-hearted

00:10:05.993 --> 00:10:07.513
and quite handsome.

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:08.473
How old are you?

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:10.873
Ms. Lu, just some noodles will do.

00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:12.593
Alright, this way, please.

00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:42.034
Careful.

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.034
He knows you.

00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:25.034
Not me.

00:12:27.353 --> 00:12:28.034
But this.

00:13:56.353 --> 00:13:57.633
Miss Nie, the noodles are ready.

00:13:58.233 --> 00:13:59.074
You're indisposed.

00:13:59.074 --> 00:14:00.154
I brought it up for you.

00:14:00.154 --> 00:14:00.993
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:05.753
Come in.

00:14:07.473 --> 00:14:08.034
Is it okay?

00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:09.914
Feigned courtesy.

00:14:13.194 --> 00:14:14.194
Enjoy.

00:14:16.473 --> 00:14:17.274
Thank you.

00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:17.833
No problem.

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:21.473
Let me.

00:14:24.554 --> 00:14:25.873
I got beaten up last time here.

00:14:26.113 --> 00:14:27.513
Now I'm here eating noodles.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:28.993
It really feels surreal.

00:14:30.713 --> 00:14:32.674
Your last visit destroyed my artwork.

00:14:32.753 --> 00:14:35.113
Now I'm treating you to noodles
at the crime scene.

00:14:35.194 --> 00:14:36.314
I'm so magnanimous.

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:41.513
Name your price.

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:42.314
I'll compensate you.

00:14:42.753 --> 00:14:44.633
My experimental phase works
aren't valuable.

00:14:45.274 --> 00:14:45.954
But the noodles

00:14:45.954 --> 00:14:48.074
condense decades
of Ms. Lu's culinary mastery.

00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:49.314
I need to calculate

00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:50.633
the compensation.

00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:53.633
Keeping such clear accounts with me?

00:14:54.993 --> 00:14:55.593
Fine.

00:14:57.154 --> 00:14:59.154
Then for my kidnapping and trafficking,

00:14:59.353 --> 00:15:00.434
how much are you paying me?

00:15:02.473 --> 00:15:04.593
How much will you pay for you driving us

00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:05.554
into the river?

00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:06.593
And you...

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:09.794
Let's eat.

00:15:16.794 --> 00:15:18.473
Where did you
find this great housekeeper?

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:19.633
Her cooking's phenomenal.

00:15:20.113 --> 00:15:22.034
She's more like family than staff.

00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:23.554
I got lucky

00:15:23.554 --> 00:15:25.034
finding Ms. Lu on my first try.

00:15:25.074 --> 00:15:26.314
She's been working for me.

00:15:31.353 --> 00:15:32.473
If you're that close,

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:33.993
why does she call you 'Miss Nie'?

00:15:34.074 --> 00:15:35.113
It sounds so formal.

00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:39.074
I've actually told her many times

00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:40.873
to just call me Luo.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.034
But Ms. Lu insists boundaries are needed

00:15:43.034 --> 00:15:44.554
for employer-employee relationships.

00:15:44.954 --> 00:15:46.233
Hence the Miss Nie title.

00:15:46.633 --> 00:15:47.753
I respect her choice.

00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:01.833
What did you say?

00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:07.554
Can...

00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:11.034
Can I call you Luo?

00:16:19.074 --> 00:16:19.674
Okay.

00:16:38.513 --> 00:16:41.034
These are all your diaries?

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:45.034
You have my permission
to pick one to read.

00:16:45.674 --> 00:16:46.233
Really?

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:52.394
I pick this one.

00:17:01.513 --> 00:17:03.034
"Won an award for the clay figurine.

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:03.794
Happy.

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:06.033
Also keyed that dirty old man's car.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:06.993
Even happier."

00:17:07.634 --> 00:17:08.993
Who's this 'dirty old man'?

00:17:10.473 --> 00:17:12.394
An art teacher
from an after-school cram school.

00:17:12.753 --> 00:17:14.513
He kept groping the female students.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:16.634
I used my house keys

00:17:17.154 --> 00:17:18.354
to scratch his crappy car

00:17:18.473 --> 00:17:19.634
with a huge line.

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:21.753
He said to call the police.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.914
I said, "Great, let's tell them

00:17:23.993 --> 00:17:25.954
how you've been harassing girls."

00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:30.954
Such righteousness since childhood.

00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:36.834
When you have no one to protect you,

00:17:37.914 --> 00:17:39.273
you naturally put on

00:17:39.273 --> 00:17:40.473
an intimidating front.

00:17:41.753 --> 00:17:43.073
If you're pampered,

00:17:44.473 --> 00:17:45.914
you can afford to be gracious.

00:17:47.154 --> 00:17:49.114
But when you only have yourself,

00:17:49.874 --> 00:17:51.473
you fight tooth and nail.

00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:55.634
What about now?

00:17:58.194 --> 00:17:59.473
Have you found someone

00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:01.434
to take care of you?

00:18:02.553 --> 00:18:04.354
Someone to pamper you

00:18:04.473 --> 00:18:05.674
and make you more tolerant?

00:18:10.874 --> 00:18:11.674
Not sure.

00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:24.394
Haven't written today's entry?

00:18:24.674 --> 00:18:25.233
Here.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:47.088
(Finally home.)

00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:55.664
(Ate Ms. Lu's noodles)

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:06.096
(together with Yan Tuo.)

00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:12.073
Can you fold paper stars?

00:19:13.313 --> 00:19:14.073
No, I can't.

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:16.073
I'll teach you.

00:19:20.313 --> 00:19:21.194
First,

00:19:21.674 --> 00:19:23.394
tie it like a bow.

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:37.078

Then press each corner firmly.

00:20:02.753 --> 00:20:04.354
That completes the star.

00:20:04.874 --> 00:20:05.394
Like this?

00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:11.233
What's that?

00:20:12.273 --> 00:20:13.793
It represents another day gone by.

00:20:27.354 --> 00:20:28.114
Mr. Yan,

00:20:28.634 --> 00:20:30.114
your room is ready.

00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:31.394
You may go there anytime.

00:20:43.273 --> 00:20:44.354
Mr. Yan, please.

00:20:44.594 --> 00:20:45.233
Thank you.

(at least don't drag her
into your whirlpool.)

♪The night sky sparks for you and me♪

00:23:02.993 --> 00:23:03.993
His name is

00:23:04.914 --> 00:23:05.954
Qin Chi, right?

00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:08.793
That's what the file says.

00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:12.033
My fault.

00:23:12.674 --> 00:23:13.954
It was a poorly chosen name.

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:16.513
He truly arrived too late.

00:23:18.793 --> 00:23:19.834
Very few people

00:23:20.914 --> 00:23:21.954
can access this place.

00:23:23.634 --> 00:23:25.553
We couldn't reach Li Yueying?

00:23:27.273 --> 00:23:28.354
The mine sent word.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.354
Li Yueying went there.

00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:38.793
I do owe her.

00:23:41.394 --> 00:23:42.594
Let's go to the mine.

00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:44.594
You two clean this up.

00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:47.154
Should I accompany you?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.600
Xiong Hei and Feng Mi can stay...

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:41.954
Why?

00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:47.674
Does it matter?

00:25:08.354 --> 00:25:09.553
I was the first

00:25:10.194 --> 00:25:11.634
to emerge from below.

00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:13.753
I survived

00:25:14.394 --> 00:25:15.874
only by heaven's mercy.

00:25:17.114 --> 00:25:19.434
When I first saw the world

00:25:19.674 --> 00:25:21.354
in human form under sunlight,

00:25:22.553 --> 00:25:23.954
I felt no relief,

00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:25.394
only fear.

00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:28.594
Even after consuming that miner,

00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:30.154
my first blood bag,

00:25:30.594 --> 00:25:32.793
and my body stabilized,

00:25:33.753 --> 00:25:36.874
and I even learned to blend
into human society,

00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:39.553
the fear remained.

00:25:42.513 --> 00:25:44.473
Do you know when

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.273
my fear finally faded?

00:25:49.914 --> 00:25:51.394
It was when I saw you

00:25:51.874 --> 00:25:53.553
successfully transformed too.

00:25:54.914 --> 00:25:56.793
My heart found peace at last.

00:25:58.194 --> 00:25:59.434
In this world,

00:26:00.473 --> 00:26:02.834
I was no longer a lonely aberration.

00:26:07.634 --> 00:26:09.434
You call this success?

00:26:12.954 --> 00:26:14.713
We had no experience back then.

00:26:16.394 --> 00:26:19.194
In haste, I made you eat that blood bag.

00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:23.033
You became alarmingly weak,

00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:24.914
even losing consciousness.

00:26:25.914 --> 00:26:27.993
Only then did we realize
the blood bag was tainted

00:26:29.634 --> 00:26:31.033
and couldn't produce offspring.

00:26:33.434 --> 00:26:35.713
All companions from your batch

00:26:36.473 --> 00:26:37.993
failed to survive.

00:26:40.114 --> 00:26:42.753
During those bleak, hopeless days,

00:26:43.354 --> 00:26:44.194
only you

00:26:44.753 --> 00:26:46.394
had seen the outside world.

00:26:51.553 --> 00:26:52.394
Filthy.

00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:53.793
Dark.

00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:55.394
Foul-smelling.

00:26:56.993 --> 00:26:59.594
Those are human prejudices about sewers.

00:27:01.313 --> 00:27:03.033
But for rats,

00:27:05.194 --> 00:27:06.354
it's paradise.

00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:09.634
To you,

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:12.154
wearing this human shell

00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:15.753
and feeling sunlight and greenery

00:27:16.553 --> 00:27:18.194
is a divine blessing.

00:27:19.273 --> 00:27:22.874
But I only feel dread, loss,

00:27:23.674 --> 00:27:24.954
and disorientation.

00:27:26.513 --> 00:27:28.553
How could you make me

00:27:28.553 --> 00:27:30.594
live in this half-dead body

00:27:31.713 --> 00:27:33.434
and pretend obedience

00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:35.713
before you,

00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:38.874
feigning gratitude?

00:27:39.194 --> 00:27:41.634
So you'd kill your own
whose roots aren't removed?

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:45.753
The method for safe root removal

00:27:46.354 --> 00:27:49.154
was discovered
through our joint efforts.

00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:53.233
They became robust,

00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:54.954
ageless, and strong,

00:27:56.073 --> 00:27:58.154
taking it for granted.

00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:03.114
They look at me with pity,

00:28:04.114 --> 00:28:06.033
as if I'm defective

00:28:07.073 --> 00:28:08.513
and I'm a monster.

00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.033
Fine.

00:28:12.914 --> 00:28:13.914
It doesn't matter.

00:28:14.354 --> 00:28:15.793
None of that matters.

00:28:18.354 --> 00:28:19.793
But when I saw you

00:28:19.793 --> 00:28:22.233
execute Gou Ya without blinking

00:28:23.594 --> 00:28:26.834
and justify it as 'following rules,'

00:28:29.313 --> 00:28:31.354
I finally understood

00:28:33.313 --> 00:28:35.194
that my days are numbered.

00:28:37.073 --> 00:28:38.154
I just hoped

00:28:38.753 --> 00:28:40.194
my future companions

00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:44.233
would never come to this human world.

00:28:47.273 --> 00:28:47.954
No.

00:28:49.273 --> 00:28:51.114
This isn't the human world.

00:28:52.954 --> 00:28:54.834
It's purgatory.

00:29:05.713 --> 00:29:06.874
The sun is about to rise.

00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:10.473
You should head back now.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.473
Ms. Lu,

00:30:39.753 --> 00:30:40.513
where's Yan Tuo?

00:30:42.033 --> 00:30:42.993
You're awake.

00:30:43.553 --> 00:30:44.914
He left early this morning.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:00.938
(Work is piling up. I need to handle it.
Rest well, and contact me anytime.)

00:31:07.154 --> 00:31:08.394
Alright, Miss Nie.

00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:09.954
Time for some exercise.

00:31:10.674 --> 00:31:11.513
What exercise?

00:31:12.473 --> 00:31:13.194
To rehabilitate.

00:31:13.594 --> 00:31:15.073
Mr. Yan ordered the equipment.

00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:16.634
I've been busy with it

00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:17.713
all this morning.

00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:55.154
Shift change.

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:58.313
I just fell asleep.

00:31:58.753 --> 00:32:00.434
Stop whining. Get up.

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:01.753
Bro.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:02.273
Up!

00:32:02.273 --> 00:32:03.154
Bro.

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:03.753
It hurts.

00:32:04.154 --> 00:32:04.713
It hurts.

00:32:04.993 --> 00:32:06.154
I've been searching forever.

00:32:06.354 --> 00:32:07.713
Fine, I'll go.

00:32:09.793 --> 00:32:10.753
Sleep carefully.

00:32:10.753 --> 00:32:11.553
It's full of bugs.

00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:23.273
Before Mr. Yan left,

00:32:23.753 --> 00:32:25.793
he kept telling me

00:32:25.874 --> 00:32:27.434
to take good care of you.

00:32:29.313 --> 00:32:30.313
When he left,

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:33.273
he wanted to pick an osmanthus branch.

00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:34.713
I stopped him.

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:36.553
Why?

00:32:40.354 --> 00:32:41.513
I mean,

00:32:41.954 --> 00:32:43.114
he saved my life.

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:44.753
Picking one flower branch

00:32:45.073 --> 00:32:46.233
shouldn't be a big deal.

00:32:46.914 --> 00:32:47.914
I told him

00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:49.473
plucked flowers

00:32:49.553 --> 00:32:50.874
lose their fragrance quickly.

00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:52.394
I suggested he should

00:32:52.513 --> 00:32:53.993
visit more often to enjoy the blooms.

00:33:03.313 --> 00:33:04.033
Mr. Changxi.

00:33:04.753 --> 00:33:06.793
Miss Nie, how's your recovery going?

00:33:07.954 --> 00:33:09.954
Much better now. Thank you.

00:33:10.674 --> 00:33:11.553
Well,

00:33:11.993 --> 00:33:13.073
my attic

00:33:13.073 --> 00:33:14.793
might have aging floorboards.

00:33:14.954 --> 00:33:17.233
I keep hearing creaking noises lately.

00:33:17.834 --> 00:33:19.194
With the recent rains,

00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:20.954
I fear your items might get damp.

00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:23.114
Should I move them elsewhere for you?

00:33:23.114 --> 00:33:23.834
Mr. Changxi,

00:33:24.914 --> 00:33:26.553
I actually need

00:33:26.594 --> 00:33:27.753
to use those soon.

00:33:28.073 --> 00:33:29.273
No need to trouble you.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:30.713
I'll come get them myself later.

00:33:31.553 --> 00:33:33.713
Alright. Come anytime. I'll be here.

00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:35.834
Great. Thanks, Mr. Changxi.

00:34:04.434 --> 00:34:07.313
Yuwang Meat often mixes
within Turquoise Land.

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:09.874
The purest one resembles a jellyfish

00:34:10.153 --> 00:34:10.993
with a jade sheen.

00:34:11.314 --> 00:34:13.914
It feels like rich butter
and glows by night.

00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:17.354
Ancient South Mountain hunter Tu
one found it.

00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:19.754
His hounds ate it
and then preyed on rabbits.

00:34:19.754 --> 00:34:21.394
They died suddenly that day.

00:34:22.113 --> 00:34:23.714
Their corpses buried in Turquoise Land

00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:25.633
rotted and spawned strange beasts.

00:34:25.993 --> 00:34:28.593
They had long ears, sharp teeth,
red eyes, and mad howls,

00:34:28.754 --> 00:34:31.354
resembling hounds and rabbits,
yet they were no hound or rabbit.

00:34:35.113 --> 00:34:36.874
Resembling hounds and rabbits,

00:34:38.274 --> 00:34:39.633
yet neither hound nor rabbit.

00:34:40.434 --> 00:34:41.633
So Yuwang Meat

00:34:42.834 --> 00:34:45.234
could merge two species.

00:34:49.113 --> 00:34:49.633
Well...

00:34:54.754 --> 00:34:56.153
South Mountain County Chronicles.

00:34:57.033 --> 00:34:59.274
Yuwang Meat regenerates endlessly

00:34:59.513 --> 00:35:01.714
and regrows to its original form.

00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:04.073
Eating it strengthens vitality,

00:35:04.673 --> 00:35:06.754
granting the longevity
of the turtle and the crane.

00:35:06.954 --> 00:35:09.673
Its eaters must retreat
from the mortal world

00:35:09.794 --> 00:35:12.553
and cultivate immortality in mountains.

00:35:13.314 --> 00:35:15.874
The emperor sought immortality methods

00:35:16.193 --> 00:35:18.314
and sent officials
to sail east for elixirs.

00:35:18.874 --> 00:35:21.354
Qin troops entered South Mountain

00:35:21.513 --> 00:35:22.754
for this very reason.

00:35:23.993 --> 00:35:25.434
Immortality?

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:46.576
(Ancient Texts)

00:35:55.354 --> 00:35:56.834
There was another named Han Guan.

00:35:56.834 --> 00:35:58.033
I've already dealt with him.

00:35:58.593 --> 00:35:59.633
This one's Chen Fu.

00:35:59.914 --> 00:36:01.234
No space to hide at my place.

00:36:06.714 --> 00:36:08.274
Leave him here. It's safe.

00:36:14.394 --> 00:36:15.314
Recently,

00:36:15.593 --> 00:36:17.954
I sorted out Earth Fiends'
human-transformation logic

00:36:18.073 --> 00:36:19.193
and got the basic pattern.

00:36:20.593 --> 00:36:21.314
Go ahead.

00:36:23.354 --> 00:36:24.673
When Earth Fiends become human,

00:36:25.153 --> 00:36:26.394
they need human nutrients

00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.794
to maintain their forms.

00:36:29.193 --> 00:36:29.954
Such humans

00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:32.234
are called blood bags.

00:36:34.434 --> 00:36:37.314
So they must constantly capture humans.

00:36:37.794 --> 00:36:38.714
It's more complicated.

00:36:39.513 --> 00:36:41.513
Blood bags require strict selection.

00:36:42.314 --> 00:36:44.673
Each generation
must be a direct bloodline.

00:36:46.234 --> 00:36:47.394
Otherwise,

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.434
Earth Fiends commit omnivory,

00:36:50.153 --> 00:36:51.954
letting Hound Clan smell them

00:36:52.234 --> 00:36:53.113
and expose themselves.

00:36:54.113 --> 00:36:56.673
When Big Head smelled a fiendish scent
in Yan Tuo's car

00:36:57.354 --> 00:36:58.794
because Gou Ya in the trunk

00:36:58.794 --> 00:37:00.193
omnivorized in the welfare home.

00:37:00.834 --> 00:37:02.434
If the requirements are this strict,

00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:06.153
how can they ensure

00:37:06.434 --> 00:37:08.234
the continuous supply of the blood bags?

00:37:09.434 --> 00:37:10.593
To control the blood bags,

00:37:11.234 --> 00:37:12.553
the Earth Fiends live with them

00:37:12.553 --> 00:37:13.874
as family members.

00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:17.434
Just like Chen Fu's girlfriend, Xu Anni,

00:37:18.473 --> 00:37:19.633
who never knew

00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:20.993
that she was in danger.

00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:23.234
If the blood bags

00:37:23.234 --> 00:37:24.993
are merely
their life-extending medicine,

00:37:25.593 --> 00:37:26.754
what exactly is the key

00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:29.153
that first transformed the Earth Fiends

00:37:30.553 --> 00:37:31.553
from beasts to humans?

00:37:39.274 --> 00:37:40.513
I'll wake him and question him.

00:37:41.874 --> 00:37:42.914
I've already done that.

00:37:43.234 --> 00:37:44.874
He didn't reveal any useful information.

00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:47.354
He even bit his own tongue.

00:37:48.394 --> 00:37:49.314
The Earth Fiends now

00:37:49.993 --> 00:37:51.553
not only possess human intelligence,

00:37:51.553 --> 00:37:52.683
consciousness, and emotions,

00:37:52.944 --> 00:37:54.354
but also have developed integrity.

00:37:56.914 --> 00:37:57.794
They have long

00:37:57.993 --> 00:37:59.794
been different from the beasts

00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:00.524
our ancestors saw.

00:38:02.874 --> 00:38:03.633
How do you know

00:38:04.673 --> 00:38:06.033
all these things?

00:38:06.754 --> 00:38:08.153
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:38:11.754 --> 00:38:13.274
Something came up and delayed me.

00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:15.914
Thankfully, Yan Tuo helped out.

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.234
It was a close call.

00:38:22.553 --> 00:38:23.193
Luo,

00:38:25.234 --> 00:38:26.193
you're Mad Blade.

00:38:27.473 --> 00:38:29.714
Mingling with someone
from the fiends' den,

00:38:30.794 --> 00:38:32.394
don't you fear he has ulterior motives?

00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:42.073
I judge people

00:38:42.794 --> 00:38:44.113
with my own discernment.

00:38:44.794 --> 00:38:46.033
You don't need to worry.

00:38:49.874 --> 00:38:50.553
Watch him.

00:38:51.153 --> 00:38:52.073
Contact me anytime.

00:38:53.673 --> 00:38:54.274
Luo.

00:38:57.553 --> 00:38:58.513
Is your injury better?

00:38:59.274 --> 00:39:00.314
I had Ma Hanzi

00:39:01.033 --> 00:39:02.914
make an ointment
with South Mountain's old way.

00:39:04.153 --> 00:39:05.314
Great for external injuries.

00:39:10.153 --> 00:39:10.794
Thank you,

00:39:11.874 --> 00:39:12.834
I'm much better.

00:39:13.954 --> 00:39:15.914
Save it for other Hunters.

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:18.234
Of course,

00:39:19.394 --> 00:39:20.633
I hope they'll never need it.
