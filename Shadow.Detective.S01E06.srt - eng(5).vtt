00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
What's missing is a top-secret file
from the Chamber.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.080
I trust you understand its significance.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.610
Very few people have access to this room.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.260
Whoever did this

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.280
won't be spared by the Chamber,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.050
and I, Zhuo Chaoxiong,
certainly won't let it slide.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.670
Only Ghost had the opportunity.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.780
He's in prison—

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.190
I've arranged everything.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.550
Go there and find him.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.800
Understood.

[Shadow Detective]

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.430
[Episode 6]

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.520
We've checked every alleyway in the area.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.520
Nobody knows the name "Ghost."

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.450
After he changed his identity,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.050
all trails went cold.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.370
Do you have any other leads?

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.079
Not at the moment.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.390
What's wrong?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.710
Did we just waste a trip coming here?

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.630
Isn't this just a normal part
of an investigation?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.700
As a police officer,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.329
you can't afford to think that way.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.120
I know,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.570
it's just...

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.880
after all these years on the job,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360
haven't you ever felt discouraged?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.840
I have.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.210
But I never once considered giving up.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.610
The patrol room

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.430
isn't a place

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.829
where you're allowed
to wallow in disappointment.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.360
Let's go.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.570
We still have plenty of work to do.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.579
Twice-cooked pork.

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.240
Ever had it?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.870
No.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.870
Braised fish? Ever had it?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
Whenever I go out,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.980
I have at least dozens of my men with me.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.250
I don't even ride in rickshaws.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.630
How could you tell?

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.010
Right here.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.120
You're dismissed.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.080
-Yes.
-Yes.

[Dear Juggernaut, I'm your biggest fan.]

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.430
What are you doing at my desk?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.510
Everyone's left.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.580
Why are you still here?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.159
I'm organizing
the household registry files.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.020
What's that? What are you hiding?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.580
Nothing.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.070
With so many files to organize,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.200
do you have time
to care about anything else?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.510
It doesn't slow me down.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.720
Didn't Dong show you how we organize them?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.450
I didn't ask.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.920
The patrol room
already has its own system.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.050
All you need to do is follow procedure—

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.390
no need to get creative.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.720
I just want to make things

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.800
more organized.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.240
Still, there's no point in wasting time

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.900
on something so unimportant.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.000
Since when is unimportant work
not considered work?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.660
Asking for help is important.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.070
What's most important here

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.560
in the patrol room is teamwork.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.800
And teamwork is built on trust.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.240
Did you bring me
into the Central Patrol Room

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.170
just to target me every single day?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.750
Lu Yizhen,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.680
you don't need to

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.700
turn everything
into a personal issue between us.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.680
I'm just explaining

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.810
how things work in the patrol room—
something every officer understands.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.450
Let me take you home.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.310
Not necessary.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.270
It's late.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.020
I said it's not necessary.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.640
I was only trying to reason with you.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.680
Yizhen!

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.570
Mom? Dad? What are you both doing here?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.800
What is wrong with you?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.560
Do my words

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.140
just go in one ear and out the other?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.120
Why are you still so close to him?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.070
Alright, alright—
let's talk about this at home.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.370
We can discuss it there.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.050
What home?

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.120
If you want to go home,
then go back to Nanyang with us!

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.560
Dad.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.190
Mom.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.830
Why are you doing this?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.640
Yizhen,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.430
the purpose of this trip is
to take you back.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.480
We will not

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.159
let you get hurt again—

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.530
especially not by him.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.190
Why are you butting in?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.150
Go back inside.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.650
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.190
I want to apologize

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.590
for what I did in the past.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.659
I don't expect your forgiveness,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.240
but you can't

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.180
let your feelings toward me

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.270
ruin Lu Yizhen's chance
to pursue her dream.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.500
To get into the patrol room,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.950
she has worked incredibly hard

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.680
and has a real talent for it—

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.120
everyone sees that.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.070
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu, I understand

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.600
that you want to protect Lu Yizhen
from getting hurt.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.830
But now that she's part
of the Central Patrol Room—

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.030
and under my command—

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.480
I am responsible for her.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.160
I don't abandon

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.600
capable officers,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.050
and I won't let them
give up on themselves.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.320
Inspector Guan,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.040
I hope you understand—

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.650
I will do whatever it takes

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.560
to make anyone
who harms my daughter pay.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.920
And I will protect every officer

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.000
under my command with my life.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.720
What kind of world is this,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.270
where wrongdoers
dare to act so brazenly?

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.680
Mom.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.120
Yizhen,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.410
we've said all there is to say.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.920
I hope you can try to understand

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.510
how a parent feels.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.270
I love you and Dad so much,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.040
but I'm exhausted.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.220
I feel like I'm suffocating.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.179
Can't I just be allowed
to live a normal life?

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:33.960
You...

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.360
How can you say that?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.840
E-Everything we do is for your own good!

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.960
Why can't you understand that?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.360
Fine—

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.170
you've grown up, haven't you?

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.850
You don't listen to your mom anymore,
do you?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.030
Alright, that's enough.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.230
Let's just drop it.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.630
I'm done.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600
I'm done trying to control you.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.690
Mrs. Lu...

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.440
Yizhen,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.930
we've made ourselves clear.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.670
If you insist on staying,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.130
you leave me no choice but

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.290
to cut off all financial support

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.900
until you're ready to return to Nanyang.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.060
You're an adult now—

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.130
it's time you learned
to take responsibility for your choices.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.510
We'll go back
after our meeting with Mr. Ke

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.480
about the Chamber's business.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.080
Take care of yourself.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.190
So now what?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.270
They cut you off.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.030
How are you supposed
to maintain this lifestyle

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.720
on a police officer's salary?

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.450
I'll take it one step at a time.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.030
You were way too harsh

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.720
with your mom, you know.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.680
Why don't you move in

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.630
with Du Linfeng

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.000
when your lease is up?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.420
You could save on rent.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.480
Why would I stay with him?

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.710
That'd be so awkward.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.570
How's your brother, by the way?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.320
He's practically vanished—
no word from him at all.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.510
No idea,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.760
he's being all secretive.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.200
But if you want to know,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.240
you could write to him.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.360
I'm sure he'd reply.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.600
I'm not writing to him.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.800
I'm not that curious.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.560
Are you really planning
to never speak again?

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.890
No wonder he's always pumping me
for information about you.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.110
I swear I haven't told him anything!

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:50.750
I…

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.630
I haven't given him

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.910
any updates about you

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.170

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.510
Well, where else would I go?

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.240
Miss Lu, your lease
has already been terminated.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.080
Here's the Lease Termination Agreement—

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.840
keep it safe.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.750
I suggest you move out sooner
rather than later,

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.340
[Lease Termination Agreement]

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.000
to avoid any unpleasantness.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.150
W-What's going on?

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.520
I never signed this.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.460
Well...

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.480
My mom did it. I'm sure of it.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.800
She forged my signature.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.660
So... what are you going to do now?

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.240
What?

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.480
What's going on?

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.960
Let me explain.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.870
I didn't sign this contract—

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.270
my mom made a mistake.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.620
So we won't be moving out.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.600
Miss Lu,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.550
the contract

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.480
is clear as day, in black and white.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.050
If you refuse to leave,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.260
fine—I'll have someone help you move.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.240
You can't just force me out.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.500
What's wrong with you?

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.840
Mr. Du, you're here.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.940
Mr. Du, the house
has been cleared for you.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.890
Long time no see.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.720
What's going on?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.750
When did you come back?

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.070
You didn't even tell me.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.130
You know each other?

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.260
Don't embarrass me in front of others.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.120
Well, this makes things easier.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.030
This young lady's lease
was terminated today,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.840
and I was just advising her
to move out promptly.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.690
I didn't terminate it, and I'm not moving.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.180
But the contract is right here
in your hands.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.790
What, are you trying to back out now?

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.480
Alright,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.660
you're dismissed.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.530
Sure thing.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.270
Since you're the tenant,

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.390
you can stay.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.120
What's mine

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.020
is yours, isn't it?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.050
Du Linfeng,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.520
you just got back
and you're already taking my place?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.400
Me? Taking your place?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.670
You bought this house specifically
to mess with me, didn't you?

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.390
I simply saw
a good investment opportunity

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.320
in this house.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.560
Why would you call that
"messing with you"?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.960
Out of all the properties in Shanghai,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.910
you just had to invest in this one?

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.570
You're clearly targeting me.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.790
I looked at many places in Shanghai,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.550
but only liked this one.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.810
Doesn't that mean we're fated?

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.200
Linfeng, it's been years,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.750
but you're still

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.730
as full of yourself as ever.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.630
Du Linfeng,
now that you've bought this place,

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.290
where are we supposed to live?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.580
Like I just said—

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.200
just pay the rent on time.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.360
That's it?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.550
No discussion about the rent?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.410
Not necessary.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.870
Once the market goes up,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.870
I'll flip it.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.120
So,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.100
after all these years,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.180
haven't I become even more charming?

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.320
How about catching up somewhere?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.600
I'm on the early shift tomorrow.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.720
Don't stay out too late.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.320
Si Min, you're really…

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.270
Looks like it's just the two of us, then.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.680
♪ Memories flow by ♪

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.210

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.910
Jingning, where are you?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.160
Never thought

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.620
I'd see the day—the great Mr. Du

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.430
eating at a street stall with me.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.240
Why not?

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.930
With your status,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.120
shouldn't you be dining

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.120
at Shanghai's finest restaurants?

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.690
Status is just a pass to get in places.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.120
Besides,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.320
there are even places

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.040
someone like me can't reach.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.650
There's a place in Shanghai
you can't reach?

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.410
For example…

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.200
into your heart.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.550
Alright, I'll stop.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480
Congratulations

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.790
on finally joining the patrol room.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.060
Did Si Min tell you that?

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.730
She wouldn't say a word.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.220
Whenever I ask about you,

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.280
she clams up tight.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.330
I'm serious now—

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.550
a sincere toast, with tea.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.850
Thank you for not leaving me
out on the street.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.360
I keep my word—

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.440
I'll pay the rent on time every month.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.690
In that case…

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.090
can I request to collect it in person?

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.880
No, you can't.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.840
Let me treat you to this meal,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.920
as a way to welcome you back.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.380
Though all I can afford
is this street stall.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.120
Then let me walk you home.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.220
A single woman out late

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.760
makes an easy target.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.250
Must you always assume the worst?

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.600
Shanghai is perfectly safe.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.080
And have you forgotten
what I do for a living?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.260
I'm heading off.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.160
Inspector, there's something off
about this case.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.210
The killer was exceptionally brutal.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.890
Show me a killer who isn't.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.680
Fair point.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.610
But it's not just the brutality—

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.250
there's something strange going on.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.200
After all these years working with me,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.000
you're still so easily shocked?

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.490
It's not just Dong who thinks it's odd—

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.770
I find it unusual too.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.410
The victim's entire scalp is missing.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.680
Her entire scalp?

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.830
See? I told you.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.550
Can you two give her some space

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.750
to examine the scene?

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.850
Try to conduct yourselves
like gentlemen, will you?

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.350
Who was she?

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.010
The victim was Chen Fangfang,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.340
a waitress at Taihua Restaurant.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.740
A neighbor noticed blood

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.350
on the floor this morning.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.530
The door was unlocked,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.680
with the key still in it.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.960
When they pushed it open,
they found the victim partially undressed,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.160
and her entire scalp and hair

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.020
were gone.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.100
If she worked at a restaurant,

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.310
how could she afford

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.370
a jade bracelet of such good quality?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.070
The apprentice has outdone the master.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.480
Inspector, you're lucky

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.790
to have such a sharp officer.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.120
Better appreciate her.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.550
Time of death?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.510
About seven or eight hours ago—

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.110
around midnight last night.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.880
Look here.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.430
There are a needle mark

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.110
in her neck

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.410
and signs of assault before death.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.330
Another suspicious detail—

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.880
I believe she was strangled
while still alive,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.540
and then her scalp was removed
with a sharp tool.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.200
We've confirmed with Taihua Restaurant—

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.330
she worked late yesterday,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.680
clocking out around 11 pm,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.010
then took the tram home.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.030
The trip would've taken
about half an hour.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.680
Did you check with the neighbors?

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.230
We did.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.610
No one heard anything.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.880
Take notes.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:23.850
On it.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.920
What have you found?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.200
The attacker likely ambushed her

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.660
from the stairwell corner

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.720
near her door,

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.070
right as she

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.180
was unlocking it.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.590
He injected a sedative

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.550
into her neck from behind,

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.720
subdued her,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.200
then pushed her inside

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.330
to commit the crime.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.420
I suspect the attacker

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.160
had been observing the victim

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.880
for some time,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.470
learning her work schedule

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.340
and address—

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.720
and had lain in wait around the time

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.980
she usually returned.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.920
This was premeditated.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.260
Well reasoned.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.830
The key was still in the lock,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.350
meaning she was attacked

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.860
while entering.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.110
No signs of struggle at the doorway,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.200
and none of the neighbors

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.660
reported unusual sounds—

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.790
suggesting the drug prevented her

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.720
from resisting or crying out.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.640
And look here:

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.930
this light bulb
was clearly broken recently.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.870
Considering she worked at the restaurant

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.500
and often returned late,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.890
think about it—

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.500
if you lived alone

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.260
and came home late every night,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.780
wouldn't you stay alert?

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.700
If she were being randomly followed,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.590
she might

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.240
have noticed it.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720
Moreover, a random stalker

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.350
would also take a huge risk—

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.670
not knowing if someone else
was at home, for instance.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.310
Dong,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.200
look into Chen Fangfang's connections.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.600
Find out who she recently met,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.060
or if she offended anyone.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.590
On it.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.330
The rest of you,
check with the other households.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.070
See if anyone noticed

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.750
suspicious individuals lately.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.310
Yes, sir.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.160
There's one more thing.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.200
The weapon was small and extremely sharp,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.350
and the killer's MO was precise.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.330
That's the only way they could
have removed the entire scalp so cleanly,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.280
leaving such a perfect wound.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.160
But why

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.090
would they take the scalp and hair?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.030
Dr. Gu.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.830
You're here.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.530
My apologies. I'm late.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.550
No need to apologize.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.830
I've worked

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.670
with the patrol room long enough

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.270
to know how things go.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.400
Have a seat.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.680
Okay.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.240
Here,

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.240
have some water.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.840
Thank you.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.310
Actually, I came to thank you.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.920
If you hadn't put in a good word for me,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.120
Inspector Guan
probably wouldn't have let me

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.920
join the investigation so soon.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.600
I only stated the facts.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.860
Inspector Guan suggested

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.420
I talk with you more often.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.110
So I'm afraid I'll be bothering you
quite a bit from now on.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.270
Not at all.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720
Inspector Guan only wants
what's best for you.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.500
And it's nice to have someone
to chat with—

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.230
especially since things
have been quiet lately.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.030
To be honest,

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.510
I do have another reason
for coming to see you.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.440
Tell me about it.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.110
You know about my past.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.840
Whenever anything slightly unsettling
happens around me,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.260
my parents panic—

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.880
they want to wrap me in cotton wool
and shut me off from the world.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880
It's really starting to weigh on me.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.400
After what you went through,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.110
it's natural for parents

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.620
to be overly protective.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.380
I know, and I understand that.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.040
But I can't live like this forever.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.200
They can't protect me my whole life,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:30.730
can they?

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.670
I want to help them let go of their fears.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.550
That's why I thought…

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.720
maybe if I could remember what happened,

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.550
everything would get better.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.720
You want me

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.400
to help you recover those memories?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.070
It won't be easy.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.160
You have to understand—

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.560
your amnesia is

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.030
a self-protective response
to severe trauma.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.640
Recalling the past

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.830
could mean

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.720
reliving that pain.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.650
I'm willing to try.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:23.960
It seems

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.870
this has become something
of an obsession for you.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.310
Maybe.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.750
I don't know.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.210
Perhaps...

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.900
Perhaps it's precisely
this obsession of yours

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.110
that makes your parents so uneasy?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.830
Some things are better left in the past.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.440
What happened to Lu Jialei

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.310
shouldn't have

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.900
to be relived by Lu Yizhen.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.010
Another case so soon?

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.920
Dong.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.750
Thanks.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.260
Brief us on the victim.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.410
Yes, sir.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.350
The victim, Wu Yushan, 27 years old,

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.400
worked as a hostess
at the West Taihua Restaurant.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.200
The West Taihua and the Taihua Restaurant

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.400
share the same owner,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.400
meaning Wu Yushan and Chen Fangfang

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.240
were technically colleagues—

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.860
though they might not
have known each other.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.800
The entire scalp is missing?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.720
Yes.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.480
According to her coworkers
at West Taihua Restaurant,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.240
she clocked out around 11 pm

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.160
and was estimated
to have returned home around midnight.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.710
A neighbor found her this morning

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.200
when they knocked on her door.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.090
Time of death was around midnight.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.090
The victim had
a hypodermic puncture wound

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.810
in her neck,

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.330
indicating she was likely drugged.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.130
She was also sexually assaulted

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.880
and ultimately died
from asphyxiation during the attack.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.680
The manner of death
was particularly brutal.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.750
Also, please note

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.160
the multiple lividity marks,

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.750
especially here on the neck.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.680
This suggests

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.350
the killer

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.200
choked her from behind

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.460
until she suffocated,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.110
then removed the scalp with a sharp tool.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.940
The MO closely matches the previous case.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.830
The light outside her door
was also tampered with.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.630
No clear signs of struggle
at the entrance either,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.550
and none of the neighbors

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.010
reported unusual sounds.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.110
The MO

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.270
is too similar—

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.290
it has to be the same perpetrator.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.240
And here's something
even more interesting.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.300
Take a look at this.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.970
Another jade bracelet?

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720
This is too much.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.230
He's taunting us.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.790
The precision of the scalp removal

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.360
suggests someone
with relevant professional skill.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.790
Footprints indicate
the killer was not tall,

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.120
but physically strong—

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.920
making it hard for the victims
to break free.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.110
The fact that both victims

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.000
worked for restaurants
under the same owner

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.330
can't be a coincidence.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.270
Our primary suspects

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.930
should be drawn
from the restaurants' frequent customers

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:26.970
and personnel.
