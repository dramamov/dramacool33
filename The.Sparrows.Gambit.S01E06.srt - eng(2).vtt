[The Sparrow's Gambit]

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
[Episode 6]

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.860
Wenbin,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.860
what brings you here?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Marshal Chen said you were wronged

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.740
at the auction the other day.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.980
He specially bought a cake

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.260
to come and apologize.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.380
Go ahead without me.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.380
I have matters to attend to.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.020
Look.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.660
Take it away! I'm allergic to mango.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.900
That shouldn't be.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.980
Marshal Chen is the one

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.740
who should know
about your allergies best.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.060
You should go now.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.180
About that woman I asked you
to investigate,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.340
look into it more thoroughly for me.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.660
Okay.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.420
Wang Wan'er has taken the bait.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.540
It's time to pull in the net.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.020
Hua,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.900
give this to Chen Wenbin.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.300
The seventh of this month,
Hot Spring Inn.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.380
I have important information to share.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.780
Liu Rumeng.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.300
Marshal Chen,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.340
you came.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.780
What do you want? Speak.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.780
Well...

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.780
I want you to see my true face.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.860
Miss Wang,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.340
I think I saw that woman.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.540
Really? Where?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.140
At the Hot Spring Inn.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.980
Rumeng,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.060
you're my closest friend.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.660
Keep an eye on her for me.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.100
I'll be right there.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.020
I'm going to see just who this woman is.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.500
Miss Wang!

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.060
The master wants you at the dock
for the goods.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.260
Stop right there!

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.740
Just who are you?

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.460
Why does that woman's figure
seem so familiar?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.020
Miss Wang.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.180
What took you so long?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.380
She's already gotten away!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.300
We can probably catch her if we go now.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.980
You stay. I'll go.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.980
Today, I will make sure that the woman

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.700
pays a thousand times over.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.220
The plan is complete.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.540
You weren't unconscious?

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.980
If I were, how could I have watched

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.940
such a brilliant performance of yours?

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.860
How come you weren't shy

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.020
when you were undressing me?

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.860
Well?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.660
Afraid I'd expose you?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.940
Expose me?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.700
Expose me for seducing you,
Marshal Chen?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.620
From the first time we met,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.180
all your actions
felt strangely familiar.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.740
Your scent,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.460
your scar,

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.380
and your Cat Claw...

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.420
I should have recognized you sooner.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.740
But I was afraid.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.420
I was terrified of losing you.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.940
Today...

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.940
I'm just grateful you're still alive.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.620
I don't know what you mean.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.540
Qingmao.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.700
Last night,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.900
the opium at the dock was hijacked.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.780
Did you know?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.420
Did you know about it?

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.660
I know.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.300
I told you to get engaged
to Chen Wenbin,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.380
not to play the scorned woman.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.580
So I'd really like to ask you.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.980
What does it matter to you

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.700
where Chen Wenbin goes?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.180
Last night,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.540
because of some woman,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.780
you caused an uproar across the city.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.140
Do you have any idea

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.140
you almost got me killed?

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.020
The auditors are arriving
at the end of the month.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.500
Before the month ends,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.220
this hole in the accounts
must be filled.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.220
Do you understand?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.820
Answer me!

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.580
Understood.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.820
Come here.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.940
I've prepared a fundraising proposal

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.540
to announce at your birthday banquet.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.500
[Invitation]
Make sure you invite
all those old foxes.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.340
And you need to understand one thing.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.980
To make those old foxes pay,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.940
we must find someone

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.700
who can keep them in check.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.700
Dad, you mean...

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.420
Chen Wenbin?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.380
We must make them understand

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.100
that our Wang family

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.340
is tied to Military Governor Chen.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.220
Only then will they

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.980
truly fear our family's influence.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.500
Don't blame me for hitting you.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.100
If anything goes wrong during this time,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.060
our Wang family

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.220
will go under.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.900
Understood?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.740
