Do you recognize them?

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.150
These two women—

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.840
did you kill them?

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.600

Tao Fan's rain boots—

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.830
the size, shape, tread pattern,

all match the boot prints found
at the crime scene.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.870
It's definitely her.

it's been confirmed.

You'd better cooperate

how you killed them.

It's fine if you don't want to talk.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.970
They deserved to die.

Whether they deserved to die

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.950
is not for you to decide.

You probably didn't do anything.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.470
Yet they mocked you,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.170
insulted you,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.070
and even isolated you.

Who did this?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.630
Tao Fan, why are you so unhygienic?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.070
You don't even throw away your trash.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.870

You haven't stopped smiling.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.530
this guy picks me up from work every day

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.910
and brings me food.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.750
He cares about everything in my life.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.730
I've never met anyone who wanted to

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.550
know so much about my life.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.270
This time it's definitely going to
work out.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.030
I...

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.360
Lu Yizhen,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.200
are you doing this on purpose?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.260
Every time I try to talk to you,
you pretend to be asleep.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.140
Inspector Guan.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.270
The victim's head was submerged
in the toilet.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.970
There's a wound on her abdomen.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.800
Judging from the shape of the wound,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.270
the murder weapon was likely
a dagger or a similar sharp object.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.080
No other weapons were found at the scene—

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.410
only these footprints.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.970
This is way too twisted.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.470
The killer stabbed her once,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.650
then dragged her to the bathroom,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.050
which means they didn't want her
to die immediately.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.250
They deliberately wanted her
to drown in the toilet.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.750
The killer acted with clear intent.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.000
We must have missed some information.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.720
I noticed a very unusual case

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.630
in the list of bullied students.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.340
Her name was Ge Xin.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.810
She took her own life by jumping from
a building at the age of 15.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.300
Yes.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.270
They bullied Ge Xin

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.870
because they said
she had an unpleasant smell.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.040
Some people said...

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.550
Ge Xin stole from Liu Xiaodan
and her friends

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.670
and was suspended.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.150
Shortly after the suspension,
this happened.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.480
But given Liu Xiaodan's behavior
at school,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.360
no one would have wanted to offend her.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.550
Ge Xin was framed.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600
Any new findings?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.300
Come look at these.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.190
Guo Luyao

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.320
was found dead
among rotting vegetables at the market.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.000
Liu Xiaodan

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.200
was found dead in a bathtub full of filth.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.400
Ma Hanqiao was found dead in the toilet.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.510
Rotting vegetables,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.030
a filthy bathtub,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.790
a toilet—

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.790
the killer's crime scene choices

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.720
all symbolically relate to smell.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.790
And Ge Xin was bullied

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.630
precisely because those three girls
mocked her

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.430
for having an unpleasant smell.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480
In other words,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.480
the killer

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.910
was using
the victims' own bullying methods

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.080
to send a message:

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.160
I'm going to take revenge on you.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.270
But...

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.560
she's been dead for so many years.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.670
I discovered
from other classmates' statements

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.000
that Ge Xin had a brother

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.670
named Ge Yunchen.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.080
Ge Yunchen.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.510
I'm Inspector Du Linfeng
from the Shanghai Police Station.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.630
We have some questions for you
regarding a case.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.560
Please come with us to the station.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.510
You two,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.440
stay here and collect evidence.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440
I'll drive.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.320
What do you know about driving?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.850
You're better off walking.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.390
Just let me try!

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.770
What do you want to know?

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.590
Yes. I killed them.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.850
You're surprisingly forthcoming.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.720
To accomplish all this,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.480
I've been planning for three years.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.790
Because they bullied
your sister back then,

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.190
you decided to kill them?

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.030
Yes.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.870
I wanted revenge on them

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.730
because they all deserved to die!

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.200
Xin was very unfortunate.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.240
She had suffered from a strange illness
since childhood

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.240
that left a peculiar smell on her.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.230
Just because of this,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
she was humiliated by those people!

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.030
Ge Xin, why do you smell so bad?

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.150
Do you not take baths?

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.110
They mocked Xin in all kinds of ways.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.820
They bullied Xin in every possible way!

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.510
Ge Xin

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.150
is so unhygienic.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.390
She's seriously damaging
our school's reputation.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.670
Why don't we all sign a petition

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.870
to have her expelled?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.750
Good idea.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.150
But I never imagined that...

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.460
I'd lost her...

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.030
I'd lost her just like that.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.910
I was too careless.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.240
Am I not worthy of any friendship?

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.000
After Xin's death,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.550
I found a diary

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.530
among her belongings.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.790
She wrote

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.980
that she was constantly bullied

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.050
at school just because of her smell!

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.710
All these years...

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.120
whenever I thought about
what they did to Xin,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.580
I couldn't suppress the rage inside me!

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.690
Ge Yunchen,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.390
calm down.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.720
Four months ago,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.390
I learned they were going to have
a class reunion.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.910
So I followed them to the hotel.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.520
Everyone, listen up.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.880
We only get to meet once a year
since graduation.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.320
Tonight, we must drink till we drop!

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.030
Come on, cheers!

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.510
Drink till we drop!

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.870
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.830
Let's dig in.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.150
I'm sorry.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.080
I was held up at work at the restaurant.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.320
Tao Fan, what a surprise!

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.390
Quickly, sit down!

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.300
Tao Fan, sit!

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.030
Hurry up and sit!

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.150
All the seats are taken.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.510
Ask someone to bring you a chair!

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.710
Or you can eat standing up if you prefer.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.030
Come on, let's drink.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.270
-Let's have a drink.
-Come on, cheers!

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.240
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.069
Everyone...

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.240
must pay the price for their actions.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.750
And their price...

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.160
is death.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.310
Dong.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.330
Do you know if Si Min was

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.460
in Liu Xiaodan's class

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.260
at Shanghai Girls' High School?

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.620
She wasn't.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.750
Are you sure?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.200
What's wrong?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.590
What about when you spoke to
those students—

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.850
did no one mention her?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.440
No.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.730
I'm certain she wasn't.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.590
Oh no.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.030
I'm afraid Si Min might be in danger.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.030
I need to go to her.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.070
What's wrong?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.210
Officer Lu called and said

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.030
they found Ge Yunchen's murder plan—

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.640
it has Si Min's name on it.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.130
You know Si Min?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.200
Who are you meeting, dressed like this?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.320
If you hadn't stopped me today,

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.990
my plan would have succeeded by now.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.780
What's the connection
between Si Min and them?

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.070
Si Min indeed had nothing to do

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.400
with those three women.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.440
However, she was...

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.640
the straw that broke the camel's back
for Xin.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.340
This bracelet of yours is so unique.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.490
It's woven with gold thread.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.920
If you like it...

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.970
you can try it on.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.270
No, thanks.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.780
It's okay.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.070
My goodness, this is truly a rare sight.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.760
Ge Xin actually has a friend?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.830
Exactly.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.850
You must be the new transfer student.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.200
You don't know—

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.670
Ge Xin doesn't care much
about her hygiene.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.160
She always smells.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.790
We're worried
that if you stay friends with her,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.650
you might pick up some bad habits.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.310
That's right.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.480
Be careful.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.640
What is this?

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.680
That's mine.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.680
It looks nice. Let me borrow it
for a couple of days.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.750
What are you doing?

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.070
What are you doing?

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.310
What are you all doing?

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.440
Are you crazy?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.640
You dare touch me now?

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.810
What are you doing?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.720
Ma'am.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.680
Ge Xin stole Si Min's bracelet.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080
We tried to get it back for her,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.440
but she wouldn't return it.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.640
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.480
I just saw it.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.480
Si Min asked for it back,
but Ge Xin refused.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.070
Right, I saw that too.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.590
Xin was suspended
because of that incident.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.200
Not long after...

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.330
she left this world.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.910
[Xihua Alley]

00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.970
Don't panic yet.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.410
We have Ge Yunchen in custody.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.720
Si Min should be fine.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.310
No.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.110
I have a really bad feeling right now.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.960
Let's hurry to the hospital.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.890
Give me the keys.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.190
The patient's condition isn't
very good right now.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.390
Do you think we should

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.920
report this to the inspectors again?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.050
I just received news

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.750
that the case she's involved in

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.110
might not be her doing at all.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.830
Another suspect has been arrested,

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.510
but they're still being interrogated,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.840
so we can't provide accurate results yet.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.480
Alright.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.000
How did Tao Fan know
where you committed the crimes?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.920
Did she deliberately mislead us

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.880
to buy you time

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.610
so you could continue killing?

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.130
She shouldn't have been dragged into this.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.180
About a year ago,

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.750
I went to eat at the Ruyi Restaurant.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.590
I accidentally ran into Tao Fan.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.400
That was when I found out

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.690
she had a very serious illness.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.570
She didn't want to burden her family,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:08.590
so

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.560
she didn't seek treatment.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.960
You saved my life.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.000
Without you, I never would've made it
this far.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.200
It's time for me to repay you.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.440
Avenging Xin

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.550
is what I, as her brother, should do!

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.200
I can't drag you into this!

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.660
If you don't want my help,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.360
I'll take this
to the police station right now

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.590
and report you for premeditated murder!

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.350
Tao Fan!

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.400
Just let me help you.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.480
I...

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.900
You can't do this alone.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.130
Let me do something for Xin.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.450
We worked out what she'd say

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.510
in her confession if she got caught.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.780
But I didn't tell her many details.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.740
I don't want Tao Fan

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.400
to actually be convicted of murder.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.900
Her health is getting worse.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.840
I don't want her to spend

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.410
her final days in prison.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.440
So,

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.200
when I learned
she had been taken away by you,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.530
I did everything I could

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.740
to kill Ma Hanqiao

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.530
as quickly as possible.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.400
Just to clear her of suspicion.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.950
Even if you hadn't caught me,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.280
after killing Si Min,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.580
I'd have turned myself in anyway.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.270
I'm going to answer the phone.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.600
Don't do anything rash.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.820
Ge Yunchen.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.590
Where were you
originally planning to kill Si Min?

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.860
You'd better tell us the truth!

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.790
Ge Yunchen.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.350
You're locked up here now.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.640
You can't do anything.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.380
But someone can act in your palce.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.950
Don't you want to
stop Tao Fan from becoming a murderer

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.160
and ending up in prison?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.550
She's escaped from the hospital now,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.280
and she's going to kill for you!

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.290
How did this happen?

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.240
Tell me everything you know now,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.680
and I can still stop her.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.750
I just wanted to bring Si Min

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.590
to the place
where Xin jumped off the building

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.750
to make her feel

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.970
the same helplessness
and despair Xin felt.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.480
Si Min never hurt Ge Xin.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.640
I'll say it again—

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.240
Si Min never hurt Ge Xin!

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:33.370
What's wrong?

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.440
Dong, Officer Lu,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.510
Tao Fan is missing!

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.400
Missing?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.370
Go find her quickly.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.160
Tao Fan somehow found out

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.090
that Ge Yunchen had been arrested.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.550
She read Ge Yunchen's notebook before,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.880
so now she's going to...

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.880
kill Si Min.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.030
But Tao Fan is terminally ill.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.920
How could she possibly do that?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.720
Never underestimate a person

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.250
who's backed into a corner.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.450
I'll check this room over here.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.880
Hello.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.370
Have you seen Dr. Si?

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.550
Dr. Si?

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.200
A patient just delivered a letter to her.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.510
She read it and left.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.390
Where did she go?

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.030
It seems her boyfriend

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.160
asked her to meet him on the rooftop.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:14.830
Quite romantic, actually.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.830
Where's the rooftop?

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.440
There are stairs over there.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.790
Dong, I'll go up first!
You go back and report this!

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.110
Watch yourself!

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.960
Okay!

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.360
What are you doing? Let go of me!

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.440
Where is Ge Yunchen? Who are you?

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.880
It's normal that you don't remember me.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.510
After all, you transferred out
not long after you transferred in.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.640
And I was such an unremarkable nobody.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.120
But there's someone you can't forget.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.550
Shortly after you transferred out,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.840
she jumped off a building.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.280
Do you still remember her?

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.720
Ge Xin.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.680
Ge Xin...

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.680
Ge Yunchen will never see you again.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.000
How could he possibly want to see

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.640
his sister's murderer?

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.200
Ge Yunchen is Ge Xin's brother?

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.590
That's right.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.070
We have no grudge against each other,

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.670
so I really shouldn't be treating you
this way.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.110
But I must

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.750
make you

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.270
pay

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.750
in the same way—for Ge Yunchen and Ge Xin.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.830
Get up.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.570
What are you doing?

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.670
Let go of me!

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.900
Let go of me!

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.350
Move!

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.960
Help! Help!

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.900
Let me go!

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.350
Help! Help!

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.720
Don't move, Tao Fan!

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.790
Yizhen, save me!

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.750
Calm down.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.880
Let Si Min come down.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.270
Help...

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:41.920
Stop!

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:42.870
Yizhen...

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.590
Tao Fan.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.030
I understand you.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.000
Really.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.240
I do.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.350
I understand Ge Yunchen too.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.080
I'm not trying to persuade you.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.210
But I want you to think about this:

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.760
if Ge Xin were still here,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.860
would she want her only friend

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.500
and her only family

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.130
to become a murderer because of her?

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.280
Of course not.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.790
She was too kind.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.270
It was because of her kindness

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.930
that she met such a tragic end.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.640
Just like when I was diagnosed
with a terminal illness,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.440
I asked myself countless times—

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.280
why did I end up like this

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.710
when I did nothing wrong?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.490
Later, I figured it out.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.610
Good people can turn evil
with one wrong thought,

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.720
while bad people can find redemption
by laying down their weapons.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.920
This world was never fair to begin with.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.600
Ge Xin and Ge Yunchen were
both good people.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.270
I don't want to see good people

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.920
suffer any more injustice.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.210
I'm a dying person anyway.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.520
I might as well use
this worthless life of mine...

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520
to seek justice.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.480
Wait!

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.980
Yizhen! Yizhen, save me!

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.740
Yizhen...

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.440
Wait!

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.890
You... Stop!

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.030
Fine.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.650
Even if everything you said is right,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.010
what did Si Min do wrong?

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.680
She never hurt Ge Xin.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.610
She's innocent!

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.750
Innocent?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.750
Knowing evil and not opposing it

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.880
is another kind of evil!

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.590
I never meant to hurt Ge Xin!

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.590
I wanted to help her!

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.510
Ma'am.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.310
Si Min,

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.680
what are you doing here?

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.920
Didn't you transfer to Yucai High School?

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.590
Ma'am, I heard Ge Xin was suspended.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.890
But what happened that day

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.220
wasn't her fault at all.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.350
It was those girls

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.610
who bullied her first.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.110
It's already over,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.820
and the punishment has been carried out.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.350
Don't meddle in this anymore.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.160
Ma'am,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.460
but that's not what really happened.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.000
If those who did nothing wrong
are punished,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.040
won't those who actually did wrong

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.570
become even more arrogant?

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.330
Okay, I understand.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.410
I'll speak to the school about it.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.270
Ma'am.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.680
I haven't been able to reach Ge Xin.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680
If she comes back,

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.920
please

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.800
give her this letter for me.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.370
Alright, you should go home now.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.920
How is that possible?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.360
How is that possible?

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.350
Everything is clear now.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.590
You need to let go of your obsession.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.280
Come down.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.990
Bring Si Min down too.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.040
Listen to me.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.480
Yizhen...

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.310
Come down first.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.830
Yizhen!

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.310
You helped her.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.830
You helped her?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.880
But as her only friend,

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.230
I did nothing!

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.440
Si Min!

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.690
-Make way! Make way!
-Come on!

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.730
-Step back!
-Step back!

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.070
Turns out I'm the other kind of evil.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.340
I'm the other kind of evil.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.310
Tao Fan.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120
Calm down.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.180
Yizhen!

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.480
Si Min!

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.550
Si Min!

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.880
Si Min!

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.070
Si Min!

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.280
Be careful!

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:53.800
Hold on!

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.470
-Hold on!
-Stay strong!

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.930
Come on!

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:58.770
Si Min...

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.580
Alright. It's okay now.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.890
Alright. You're fine now.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.600
How are you? Are you alright?

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.480
Where does it hurt?

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.400
Say something, Si Min!

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.110
Everything hurts.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.140
E-Everything...

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.100
Fortunately, she's just frightened.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.100
No injuries.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200
What about you? Did you get checked?

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.240
How could anything be wrong with him?

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.170
My arm hurts, and my back hurts too.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.770
Look, now that I mention it—
this spot right here.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.970
My funny bone here...

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.740
Don't stay here any longer.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.300
Go home.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.930
I'll take her directly to my place later.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:55.860
No need to worry.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.460
Let me drive you home.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.870
She's my sister.
Of course, I'll take them.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.270
Lu Yizhen is my subordinate.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:06.960
Then I'm...

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.540
Enough! Stop messing around! Go!

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.750
Go!

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.480
Go!

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.140
Hurry.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.020
-I'm leaving, Si Min.
-Go! Hurry!

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.190
Those two

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.910
didn't come here to check on me at all.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.300
They came to impress you.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.450
How can you say
they weren't here to check on you?

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.170
No.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.090
Isn't that obvious?

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.590
Their feelings for you

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.470
are crystal clear.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.820
How long are you going to play dumb?

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.720
You just suffered for love yourself,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.780
and now you want to drag me into it too?

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.280
I met the wrong person,

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.710
but at least you have my cousin's
genuine affection...

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.830
I'm serious.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.270
Love is about mutual feelings.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.160
Your cousin is a really, really nice man,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.200
but I've never felt anything for him.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.310
He's my superior.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.980
After all this talk,

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.300
you've really fallen for Guan Cen...

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.350
You don't love me anymore...

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.240
Of course I love you.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.640
When have I ever tried to sweet-talk him?

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.900
I only sweet-talk you.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.840
Right? Okay.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.450
Alright, let's go home.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.270
Come on, I'll take you home.
