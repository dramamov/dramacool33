This barrier is infused

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.397
with the scent of our own.

00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:04.277
I set it up,

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:06.157
so only we can see through it.

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:08.316
No one else
can perceive anything unusual.

00:02:08.317 --> 00:02:11.437
This way, we can hide Yue inside.

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:20.558
My technique finally comes in handy.

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:22.596
Xiaoyu, aside from us,

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:23.916
no one from Wujing can detect

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.196
that Yue is hiding within.

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:26.236
(Hunbao, you're amazing.)

00:02:26.237 --> 00:02:27.957
(You came up with such a clever plan.)

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:29.837
The most dangerous place

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:31.717
is the safest place.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.157
You can also prepare some tonic for Yue

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:36.237
to help her regain her senses quickly

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:37.517
and reunite with Zhilou.

00:02:53.838 --> 00:02:55.077
Dragon God,

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:58.478
you're staring at me so intently.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.837
Do you fancy me that much?

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.237
Do you know what you're doing?

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.038
What's wrong?

00:03:42.838 --> 00:03:44.038
Are you scared?

Chu Moshang.

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:02.878
I feel as if I've returned
to that snowy day

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:06.438
when we first met.

00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:09.517
You offered a sincere prayer
to the Dragon God,

00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:12.158
which brought me before you.

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:15.598
You are a Dragon,

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:17.277
the Dragon of the sacred land.

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:20.397
The lofty Dragon God

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:22.411

Zhilou,

00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:29.878
it's just a nightmare.

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:31.998
We've rescued your mother.

00:05:32.678 --> 00:05:33.758
Right.

00:05:34.077 --> 00:05:34.918
You're right.

00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:38.717
After all these years
as a loser without a mother,

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:40.837
I have finally found her.

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:42.397
Right.

00:05:45.558 --> 00:05:47.277
You not only have your mother

00:05:47.878 --> 00:05:48.837
but also me,

00:05:49.277 --> 00:05:50.276
Hunbao,

00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:51.318
and Xiaoyu.

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:53.558
We will always love you.

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:16.836
The people from Wujing City

00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:17.636
kept looking for me

00:06:17.637 --> 00:06:18.756
but never found me.

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:19.477
Well,

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:19.956
Zhilou?

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:21.358
Do you think I'm impressive?

00:06:21.558 --> 00:06:22.677
The skin you shed

00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:24.636
could be used as an invisibility cloak.

00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:25.997
It'd be strange if you had no way

00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:27.318
to protect yourself.

00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:30.837
What?

00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:32.316
Zhilou,

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:35.157
why do you carry the scent
of Young Master?

00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:42.316
We have spent much time together.

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:44.238
It's only natural

00:06:44.317 --> 00:06:45.758
to share each other's scent.

00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:48.357
I knew you two get along best

00:06:48.358 --> 00:06:49.837
with each other.

00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:52.677
I almost forgot what I came for.

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:53.597
Where's my mother?

00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:54.797
She is safe.

00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:56.957
The seal I placed is strong.

00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:14.717
Mother.

00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:17.957
Don't harm...

00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:20.198
Don't harm Feng Manor.

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.358
Li Yue,

00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:31.836
you used dark sorcery

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:34.037
to assume my appearance and identity.

00:07:34.238 --> 00:07:36.238
You obtained everything you desired.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.877
What else do you want now?

00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.557
My son is Wujing City Young Lord,

00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:42.358
but he's blind.

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:45.997
My appearance is slowly returning
to its former ugliness.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.276
People will eventually find out I'm not

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:50.678
of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:52.477
Bloodline matters

00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:54.438
can only be resolved
through reincarnation.

00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:56.316
After all, what you stole

00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:58.558
was never yours to take.

00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:00.438
Yes.

00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:03.758
But I heard
before you returned to Wujing City,

00:08:04.438 --> 00:08:07.198
you stayed some time at Feng Manor.

00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:08.877
Don't you want your daughter

00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.878
to return to Wujing City?

00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:13.558
After all, she is the bloodline
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:08:13.637 --> 00:08:15.878
She is to marry a Dragon

00:08:16.397 --> 00:08:18.118
and become the Dragon Queen.

00:08:19.517 --> 00:08:20.997
Li Yue, you...

00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:23.357
So do you want your daughter dead

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:25.998
and the entire Feng Manor
to perish with her?

00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:28.798
Or will you meet my demands?

00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:31.037
What exactly do you want?

00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:35.318
I want my son
to see the light of day again.

00:08:35.358 --> 00:08:37.558
I want eternal youth.

00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:39.676
I want everyone to believe

00:08:39.677 --> 00:08:40.756
that I

00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:43.558
am the true bloodline
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.877
What about my daughter?

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:48.117
I will bring her back to Wujing City,

00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:50.077
grant her the status of a princess,

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:53.638
and let her
become the future Dragon Queen.

00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:54.678
Don't harm my daughter!

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.197
Don't harm my daughter.

00:08:57.198 --> 00:08:58.198
Mother.

00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:00.237
Don't be afraid.

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:02.318
- Don't harm my daughter.
- Don't be afraid, Mother.

00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:04.469
I have rescued you from the dungeon.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.709
You will no longer suffer.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.790
It's alright now.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.990
You're alright.

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:09.158
Feng Manor...

00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:10.556
Feng Manor...

00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:12.756
Feng Manor will protect my child, right?

00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:13.436
Yes.

00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:14.077
Yes.

00:09:14.078 --> 00:09:15.638
I brought this on my daughter.

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:17.237
No.

00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:17.997
My daughter...

00:09:17.998 --> 00:09:19.717
My daughter is surely in Wujing.

00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:21.237
She must be in Wujing.

00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:22.757
No.

00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:23.756
Wait, no.

00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:25.357
She is at Feng Manor.

00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:26.717
Where...

00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:28.036
Where is...

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:29.237
Where is my daughter?

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:29.796
Where is she?

00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:30.237
Mother.

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:30.837
Where is she?

00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:31.717
I am right here.

00:09:31.757 --> 00:09:32.717
Mother,

00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:34.997
I am by your side.

00:09:34.998 --> 00:09:37.237
Is she at Feng Manor or Wujing City?

00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:39.077
I am before you,

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:39.837
Mother.

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:40.837
No.

00:09:41.318 --> 00:09:42.558
It's alright, Mother.

00:09:44.238 --> 00:09:45.997
I will take you back to Feng Manor.

00:09:46.037 --> 00:09:47.558
Everything will get better.

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:48.957
It's alright.

00:09:49.118 --> 00:09:49.676
My daughter.

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:50.798
It's alright.

00:09:56.718 --> 00:09:57.477
Your Grace,

00:09:57.637 --> 00:09:58.357
we have sent people

00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:00.678
to search the Young Lord's
Dongming Hall.

00:10:00.718 --> 00:10:02.638
There is no sign of Yue.

00:10:03.397 --> 00:10:05.556
Feng Zhilou and Li Yan must have

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.357
rescued her together.

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:09.717
We have searched everywhere.

00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:11.597
Where else could they be hiding her?

00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:14.438
That wretched Feng Zhilou.

00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:16.877
Not only is Prince Shang protecting her,

00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:18.556
but she also stole my blood vessel.

00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:20.638
How am I to survive
until the wedding day?

00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:21.796
Where is Baiyue?

00:10:21.797 --> 00:10:23.036
What is he up to these days?

00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:25.237
The Dragon Prince
of the sanctuary has arrived.

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:28.318
Princess Liluo, please come out
to greet him at once.

00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:39.997
Why are you here?

00:10:41.277 --> 00:10:43.077
I came to check on you

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:45.077
and see what you plan to do next.

00:10:45.198 --> 00:10:46.638
You're asking me?

00:10:46.998 --> 00:10:49.357
You Dragons betrayed your word.

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:52.278
I should be the one
asking what you plan to do.

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:55.997
Are you planning
to eliminate Feng Zhilou

00:10:56.277 --> 00:10:58.597
or continue to seduce my brother

00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:00.717
until he agrees to marry you

00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:02.438
even though

00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:05.997
you have already proven
you're the Wujing Saintess?

00:11:07.277 --> 00:11:08.518
Prince Zhi,

00:11:09.277 --> 00:11:11.597
don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:13.756
A Dragon Prince
cannot become the Dragon King

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.477
without marrying the Wujing Saintess.

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:16.837
You

00:11:17.437 --> 00:11:19.518
are just a supporting act.

00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:25.477
Precisely because of this,

00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:28.518
we ought to sympathize with each other.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.036
In our families,

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:34.997
we've always fallen short
of their full regard.

00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:37.638
And you,

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.757
as the Wujing Saintess,

00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:42.638
have been rejected by Prince Shang.

00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:44.077
As for me,

00:11:44.358 --> 00:11:46.357
I am the Dragon Prince,

00:11:46.358 --> 00:11:47.796
but in my father's eyes,

00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:49.918
he only ever wishes
to see his other son.

00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:54.957
You mean to say

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.916
we are fellow sufferers?

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:57.436
No.

00:11:57.437 --> 00:11:58.837
I prefer

00:11:58.878 --> 00:12:00.798
a strong alliance.

00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:15.158
My sight is much better than before.

00:12:15.757 --> 00:12:17.318
Besides seeing colors,

00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:19.278
I can make out some shapes now.

00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:29.357
Xiaoyu,

00:12:30.157 --> 00:12:31.318
what's wrong?

00:13:00.557 --> 00:13:03.396
You always carry the fragrance
of various herbs

00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:04.877
from the apothecary.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.117
It's a soothing scent.

00:13:11.677 --> 00:13:12.638
Xiaoyu,

00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:15.077
how is the night tonight?

00:13:33.037 --> 00:13:35.518
As dusk falls,
shadows stir and cicadas sing.

00:13:37.037 --> 00:13:39.837
The blooming moon
spills summer's gentle sting.

00:13:40.637 --> 00:13:44.038
Beneath the ink-black sky,
the moonlight gleams.

00:13:44.637 --> 00:13:48.038
I invite you to share
this firefly dream.

00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.077
Xiaoyu.

00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:03.158
Xiaoyu?

00:14:04.517 --> 00:14:05.638
Xiaoyu.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:07.678
Where are you?

00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:38.597
You mean to say

00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:40.318
they are as beautiful as the moonlight?

00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:09.278
Xiaoyu.

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.318
Thank you.

00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:16.158
Since I learned

00:15:16.238 --> 00:15:18.318
that my family stole Miss Zhilou's

00:15:18.598 --> 00:15:20.038
and Miss Yue's lives,

00:15:20.517 --> 00:15:22.757
I have been afraid
to face my mother and sister.

00:15:23.118 --> 00:15:25.077
But they are still my closest kin.

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.318
How should I atone for them?

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:37.477
Xiaoyu,

00:15:38.078 --> 00:15:39.918
have I upset you again?

00:15:54.478 --> 00:15:55.558
Xiaoyu.

00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:57.117
Take a look.

00:15:57.118 --> 00:16:00.798
This is what I found among the herbs
that were delivered today.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.477
(What kind of flower is this?)

00:16:07.157 --> 00:16:07.957
You can find this

00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.957
everywhere in Feng Manor.

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:10.756
It is actually

00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:11.997
a type of medicinal herb.

00:16:11.998 --> 00:16:13.877
Its roots, stems, flowers,

00:16:13.878 --> 00:16:15.636
and seeds can all be used in medicine.

00:16:15.637 --> 00:16:16.916
The most common ailments it treats

00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:18.036
are bruises and injuries.

00:16:18.037 --> 00:16:19.158
It can reduce swelling.

00:16:19.358 --> 00:16:20.756
I used to often use it

00:16:20.757 --> 00:16:22.678
to treat my own bruises.

00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:23.678
But

00:16:23.718 --> 00:16:24.676
in the village,

00:16:24.677 --> 00:16:26.237
many other ladies

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:29.318
use its flowers and leaves
to dye their nails.

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:37.237
I used to often think,

00:16:37.238 --> 00:16:40.398
if only I had a close friend,

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:42.197
I could be like

00:16:42.198 --> 00:16:43.717
the other ladies in the village,

00:16:44.198 --> 00:16:46.156
dyeing each other's nails,

00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:48.877
chatting about the happiest things,

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:52.757
and waiting for our nails
to turn red and beautiful.

00:16:54.838 --> 00:16:57.318
I think the heavens

00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:58.918
must have heard my wish.

00:16:58.998 --> 00:16:59.916
So

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:01.957
they sent you to be by my side.

00:17:02.118 --> 00:17:06.038
(I want pretty nails too.)

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:08.756
Wait.

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:09.997
I'll make it now.

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:13.477
What is that?

00:17:13.675 --> 00:17:15.557
(Encyclopedia of Seventy-Two Illnesses)

00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:17.757
Has the apothecary
assigned you new tasks again?

00:17:17.758 --> 00:17:19.517
I can help you share some of the burden.

00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:32.398
You want to cure Li Yan's eyes,
don't you?

00:17:36.118 --> 00:17:38.236
But it will be very difficult

00:17:38.237 --> 00:17:39.757
to do that.

00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:44.757
(No matter the hardship,
I'm not afraid.)

00:17:45.038 --> 00:17:46.678
Whatever you wish to do,

00:17:47.118 --> 00:17:48.438
I will surely help you,

00:17:48.558 --> 00:17:50.438
just like you helped me.

00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:13.797
Still haven't found her?

00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:15.597
It only took a blink.

00:18:15.598 --> 00:18:17.237
It's not like Yue can fly.

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:19.997
Right.

00:18:20.437 --> 00:18:22.236
Have you asked Chu Xiaoyu?

00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:24.237
Wasn't she in the garden that day?

00:18:24.518 --> 00:18:26.078
She should have seen something.

00:18:27.637 --> 00:18:28.717
Your Grace,

00:18:29.477 --> 00:18:32.557
I would never allow anyone
to come and go from the dungeon,

00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:34.638
unless...

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:36.477
Right.

00:18:37.038 --> 00:18:38.277
Funny how it was

00:18:38.278 --> 00:18:40.957
that wretched woman
handling the body transport.

00:18:42.118 --> 00:18:44.358
Well, well, Xiaoyu.

00:18:45.237 --> 00:18:47.037
Bring her here.

00:18:47.318 --> 00:18:48.398
Yes, Your Grace.
