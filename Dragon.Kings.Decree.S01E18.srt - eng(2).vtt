=Dragon King's Decree=

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:59.220
=Episode 18=

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.099
I heard from the elders

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.539
that you finally recognized

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
your place and duty
beneath the Tree of Life.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.739
No matter whether Moshang or I
become Dragon King,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.739
we will never forget

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.379
the mission we were born with.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.859
We should support each other

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.659
and safeguard both the sanctuary
and the mortal realm.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.938
Today, the sanctuary

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.019
will hold the Wujing Saintess'

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.220
inspection ritual together.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.459
Father, please grant me one more chance.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.819
If that is your wish,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.218
then you and the elders

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.019
shall travel to Wujing City
to represent the sanctuary.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.098
Watch Moshang complete

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.058
the Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual as promised.

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.139
No mistake is allowed.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.938
It is my honor
to offer my humble efforts

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.340
to the sanctuary.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.419
I will ensure the ritual goes smoothly

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.419
to ease the burdens

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.099
of you and Moshang.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.620
Young Master,

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.620
it's time to depart for War God's Hall.

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:19.900
Have you seen Zhilou?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.260
(Youyun Pavilion)

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:39.620
I hope...

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.259
everything goes well today.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.500
I will await your return.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.500
Young Master.

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.699
Wait for me.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.178
Moshang,

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:46.338
you don't look

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:48.179
very happy.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.499
Oh, right. Where is that village girl
you nearly died protecting?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.940
Did she not come to witness the ritual?

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.859
I warn you.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.099
Don't touch Feng Zhilou.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.419
Moshang,

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:17.619
you are truly pitiful.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.739
You stand so close to her,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.140
yet she has no right
to stand by your side.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.338
In the end,

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.340
you are destined
to become another's husband.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.979
What's wrong?

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:35.780
Struck a nerve?

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.220
You're displeased?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.460
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.140
The Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual now begins!

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.539
It worked.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.218
It worked.

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:04.059
Look.

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:07.260
Seems like

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.139
Princess Liluo of Wujing

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.820
truly bears
the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.418
Your Highness,

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.340
Elders,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.939
the inspection ritual is complete.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.259
Princess Liluo of Wujing

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.978
is indeed
the Wujing Saintess' descendant.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.338
In that case,

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.218
we shall return to the sanctuary

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.538
and begin preparations for my brother

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.539
and Princess Liluo's wedding.

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.019
We kindly ask the sanctuary to oversee

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.820
Liluo's wedding with His Highness.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:41.700
(Why does she look exactly
like my mother?)

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.299
Hold on.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.619
Before we return to the sanctuary,

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:47.900
I must resolve a question in my mind.

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:49.220
This matter

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.020
concerns the safety of the sanctuary
and the mortal realm.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.340
Li Yue,

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:56.459
at your age,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.059
how do you still look so young?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.140
Do none of you find this strange?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.658
I didn't think so before.

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:02.858
Now that he mentions it,

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:04.459
it seems quite strange.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.380
Right.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.140
He's right.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.580
Your Highness, you know the truth.

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:12.619
It's because I carry
the Wujing Saintess' bloodline

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:15.978
and have taken life-prolonging tonics
for many years.

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:16.940
Is it tonics...

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.179
or forbidden arts?

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:21.979
Moshang,

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:24.940
today is supposed to be your big day.

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.659
Do you understand what you're saying?

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:30.499
Today is just
the Wujing Saintess' inspection ritual.

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.859
Where is this "big day" of mine?

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:36.540
Rongzhi,

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:38.700
do you even understand

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.460
what you're saying?

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:45.700
Young Master,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.940
with the Wujing Saintess' bloodline

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.660
and years of martial cultivation,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.660
even as a human,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.458
her lifespan

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.259
far exceeds that of ordinary people.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.660
Remaining youthful

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.460
for decades is normal.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.700
If you hadn't long consumed human blood

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:07.739
and used forbidden arts
to preserve your looks,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.139
tainting yourself with blood poison,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.899
you wouldn't look like a withered crone

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.578
or suffer unbearable pain

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:14.619
when the poison flares.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.499
Is that true?

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.779
She consumed human blood?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.779
Your Highness,

00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:29.418
do not heed such rumors.

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:32.178
I stand before you healthy.

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:33.339
And Liluo

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.139
has been confirmed
as the Wujing Saintess' descendant.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.899
I am the Wujing City Lord.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.820
Why would I consume human blood?

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:42.298
In truth, my visit here today

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:43.499
was not only to confirm

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.979
the Wujing Saintess' identity.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.300
More importantly,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.698
I came to inform Wujing

00:09:47.699 --> 00:09:49.940
that I am canceling
my engagement to Liluo.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:55.660
Moshang,

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.099
there are so many people here today.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.458
Are you really announcing
that you're ending your engagement,

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:02.340
giving up marrying the Wujing Saintess,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.720
and abandoning your claim
to the Dragon King's throne?

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:06.700
Marrying the Wujing Saintess

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.220
was always the sanctuary's decision.

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:11.700
Don't forget the Dragon King's Decree.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.219
Only the Dragon Prince
who weds the Wujing Saintess

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.340
can become the true Dragon King.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.779
I'll say it again.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.379
Whether I marry the Wujing Saintess

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.219
has nothing to do
with whether I'm worthy

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.818
of becoming Dragon King or whether

00:10:25.819 --> 00:10:27.499
I can save the sanctuary and all life

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:28.778
in the world.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.099
Chu Moshang,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.219
you acted on your own,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.698
disrupting the union
between the sanctuary and Wujing.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.099
How do you plan to answer

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.899
to us and to the Dragon King?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.019
I will

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:40.219
return to the sanctuary

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.099
and explain everything to Father.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.859
You need not worry.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.859
Very well.

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.340
Moshang,

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.259
you said it yourself.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.019
When the time comes,

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:57.300
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.899
Why...

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.418
Why is this happening?

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:15.859
I have already passed

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.379
the inspection ritual.

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:19.499
Why did the Dragon Princes leave?

00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:21.058
Why would Prince Shang give up

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:22.058
his engagement to me?

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:24.259
Give me an explanation!

00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:25.300
Elders,

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:26.698
is this the sanctuary's idea

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:28.379
of sincerity toward Wujing?

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.458
Breaking your word

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:30.979
and toying with us like this?

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:32.859
This is an emergency.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.300
Just wait for news from the sanctuary.

00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:37.979
Elders,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.180
for the sake of the sanctuary

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:43.379
and the future of the mortal realm,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.739
you would not dare go against

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.859
the Dragon King's Decree, would you?

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.300
Of course.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.420
Elders!

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:56.700
My lord!

00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:59.619
She fainted from shock.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.139
Send her back to the Longevity Hall.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.698
You wretch! How dare you disregard
the safety of the sanctuary

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:06.058
and the mortal realm?

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.220
On your knees!

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.259
Father,

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:13.379
every word I said is true.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.058
Li Yue's strange illness

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:17.060
has worsened over the past 18 years.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.298
Those who served her and treated her

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:20.658
have died one after another.

00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:22.178
The physician closest to her

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.418
is a mute girl.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.979
I sent you to the mortal realm
to retrieve the sigil

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.660
and verify
the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:31.499
Not to meddle

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.540
in the petty schemes of the Humans.

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:36.818
If every human dispute

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:38.778
required our intervention,

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:41.019
why would the heavens grant power

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.340
to us Dragons?

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:43.779
Father,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.859
this concerns the Dragon King's Decree.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.818
What does it

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:49.899
have to do with Li Yue's illness?

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.778
Or with your refusal to marry?

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:53.220
Wujing City Lord, Li Yue,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.180
is not of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.099
That is why

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.660
she suffers from blood poisoning.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.058
If that's the case,

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.300
then Liluo is not the Wujing Saintess.

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:03.540
Moshang,

00:13:03.819 --> 00:13:05.340
we've all witnessed

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.139
the verification

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.219
of Princess Liluo's identity

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.818
as the Wujing Saintess that day.

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:12.019
Now you're denying it

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.899
and making up such a bizarre excuse?

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:16.139
This isn't just
about refusing the marriage, is it?

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.619
Is this

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.420
for your beloved,

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.979
Feng Zhilou?

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.940
I merely did what I believe is right.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.180
Princess Liluo

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.099
lacks virtue.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.379
She is cruel and violent.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.339
She is unfit to bear

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.940
the title of Wujing Saintess.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.019
We Dragons

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.499
can never take such a woman
as Dragon Queen.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.300
Seems like

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.700
you want both Feng Zhilou

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.820
and the Dragon King's throne.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.979
Are you going to say

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.019
that the real Wujing Saintess

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:45.739
is Feng Zhilou?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.420
Stop fanning the flames.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.139
Whoever Feng Zhilou is

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.220
and whoever the Wujing Saintess may be,

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.660
the only one I long for

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.259
is Feng Zhilou.

00:13:56.179 --> 00:13:58.820
Then today's inspection ritual

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:01.060
has become nothing but a joke.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.019
Shang,

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:05.739
marry Liluo

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.580
and inherit the Dragon King's throne,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.899
or be with Feng Zhilou, that human girl.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.979
You can choose only one.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.139
Father,

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:17.580
if inheriting the throne

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:19.700
means marrying Liluo,

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:22.019
then I would rather give up the throne.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.418
I placed great hopes on you.

00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:28.660
You're shouldering the fate
of us Dragons

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.499
and the lives of all living beings.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.180
Father,

00:14:33.419 --> 00:14:34.940
have you ever considered

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:37.099
what the Wujing Saintess
truly represents?

00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:39.178
In ancient times, was she also

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.418
nothing more than a tool

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:41.658
to be married off to us?

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:44.538
Could a marriage alliance
really summon the Dragon King's Decree,

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:46.058
restore the sanctuary's barrier,

00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.938
and save the world?

00:14:47.939 --> 00:14:50.460
I don't care who the Wujing Saintess is.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.139
I care only for the barrier.

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:55.578
Liluo's bloodline
has already been verified.

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:57.259
She is the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.619
That means she can fulfill

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.899
the Dragon King's prophecy.
That is enough.

00:15:01.939 --> 00:15:03.379
I will ask you once more.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.818
Are you sure you want to give up

00:15:04.819 --> 00:15:06.499
the Dragon King's throne

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.578
for an ordinary human girl?

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:09.540
Father,

00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:11.899
the throne was never what I wanted.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.940
What I want is to fail
neither the people nor you.

00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:15.700
Moshang,

00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:17.739
you may have given Feng Zhilou

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.499
the sanctuary's sigil
and the Fire Phoenix pendant,

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:21.938
but you cannot disregard

00:15:21.939 --> 00:15:23.420
the Dragon King's Decree for her.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.420
By doing so, you place our sanctuary

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.220
and the mortal realm in danger.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.259
Young Master,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.818
you actually gave Feng Zhilou

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:32.660
the Fire Phoenix pendant too?

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:34.739
Yes.

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:36.418
The Fire Phoenix pendant

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:39.180
is the token a Dragon Prince
gives his wife.

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:41.499
It belongs to me.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.859
I can give it to whomever I choose.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.700
Besides,

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:47.178
Feng Zhilou is no ordinary girl.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.220
She is the one I have chosen as my wife.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.578
Calm down, Father.

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:00.619
Moshang was just like that
in the mortal realm.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.859
He rejected the marriage in public,
abandoned the Saintess,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.058
and disgraced Wujing City.

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:07.219
And now he dares defy me as well.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.300
I believe Moshang acts this way today

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.058
only because he was blinded

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:12.540
by Feng Zhilou saving his life.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.778
Our top priority now

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:15.499
is to calm Wujing City

00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:18.219
and continue the alliance between us.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.340
I'll leave the matters
of Wujing City to you.

00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:21.859
Don't disappoint me.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.460
Yes, Father.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.340
I endured all this suffering

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:30.460
to marry a Dragon.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.139
And what did I get in return?

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.938
Public humiliation.

00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:35.220
Your Grace,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.580
nothing is decided yet.

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:40.298
Though Prince Shang acted impulsively,

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.619
as long as the Dragon King remains,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.899
this marriage,
meant for all life in the world,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.820
must be fulfilled.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.499
But haven't you seen

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.698
that he is starting to suspect

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:53.259
Mother's blood poisoning?

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.259
But today, you have proven before all

00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:59.058
your bloodline as the Wujing Saintess.

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:02.058
Next, we just need
to quickly finalize the marriage.

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:03.420
Everything will be settled.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.220
Who could possibly go back on it?

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.660
It seems I have been
far too soft-hearted.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.819
I should have had Feng Zhilou killed

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.380
before she entered Wujing City.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.579
Feng Zhilou must not be killed.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.938
Yue's power as the Wujing Saintess

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:19.460
is pitifully weak now.

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:20.900
Feng Zhilou

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:23.019
is your spare blood vessel.

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:25.339
She must not be killed?

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.059
She must not be killed,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.339
so I must let her walk over me?

00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:33.700
Once I become the Dragon Queen,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.698
I will have her turned
into a dried corpse

00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:39.019
to vent my frustration.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.259
Inform Chu Xiaoyu

00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:43.779
to prepare the blood-restoring tonic

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.940
and come with me to the dungeon.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.418
That wicked woman is truly hateful.

00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:51.339
Zhilou,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.900
you have formidable martial skills.

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:53.579
Just storm in

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.059
and rescue your mother.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.180
I can't.

00:17:56.219 --> 00:17:57.660
Even if I fight my way

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.739
through the heavily guarded dungeon,

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:02.140
taking my mother out with me

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:03.660
would be difficult.

00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:05.498
She has no martial skill now,

00:18:05.499 --> 00:18:06.658
and her mind is clouded.

00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:08.140
She could easily be harmed.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.379
I can't take even the slightest risk.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.619
Then what shall we do?

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.859
Just watch helplessly

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.658
as your mother

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:15.739
is bullied by that wicked woman?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.620
The Dragon Prince

00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:21.139
rejected the marriage publicly
at the War God's Hall.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.940
Liluo will surely draw blood again.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.299
Let's enter the dungeon again.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.418
(Liluo told me to prepare the tonic)

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:34.660
(and go to the dungeon with her.)

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:05.634
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:11.630
