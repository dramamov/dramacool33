00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:14.880
(My Fate Is in My Own Hands)

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.400
Stop right there!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
Noble Consort Xian.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Forgive me,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800
but I don't know what I did

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.960
to anger Consort Chun so gravely

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.320
that she demands my hands chopped.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.360
I'm innocent!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.440
I beg Your Highness to save me.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.240
Your Highness,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.080
why would a mere convict maid

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.400
deserve your personal attention?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.880
Consort Chun.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.040
What offense did this maid commit?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.640
I've been cultivating orchids
for His Majesty.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600
The fertilizer from Hard-Labor Ward

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.800
caused the leaves to wither.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.440
I came

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.760
to take Lu Jiuning

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.080
back to Yongxiu Palace to salvage them.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.000
Unless she's committed serious crimes,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320
you shouldn't disable her, Consort Chun.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.240
Lest people say

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.160
you abuse palace staff.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.120
Release her!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.400
Noble Consort Xian,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
the fertilizer

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.080
is my fault.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
I'll immediately

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.280
prepare new fertilizer for you.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.160
Come with me.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.640
Yes.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.808
Come.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.080
(Consort Chun,)

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.600
(turns out)

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.200
(you're this desperate to eliminate me?)

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.600
(Lady Yu was right about you.)

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.280
(Your involvement in Wan'er's death)

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.720
(is undeniable.)

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:23.104
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.240
I've sinned.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.560
Please punish me, Your Highness.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640
What did you do?

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:37.240
(Yanqiu, Chief Maid)

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.320
(Yunxiang, Chief Maid)
Yanqiu came to Hard-Labor Ward

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.200
requesting orchid fertilizer.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.920
I took it upon myself

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.560
to add bean cake residue
to your fertilizer,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.600
causing mole cricket disease.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.240
So you mean

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.200
you lured me to Hard-Labor Ward

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.040
and used me

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.640
to rescue you from Consort Chun?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.080
I anticipated

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.080
Consort Chun's outburst

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.880
and I knew Your Highness

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.840
values flowers above all.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.600
Thus

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.640
I sabotaged your fertilizer,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.680
forcing you to intervene

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.760
to save both orchids and me.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.560
I manipulated Your Highness

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.200
to save myself.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.920
I know my guilt.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.200
I dare not lie.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.760
Please punish me.

00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.080
What insolence!

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.160
I know I was wrong.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.440
I accept punishment.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.040
Yanqiu.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720
Fetch her an umbrella.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.680
Yes.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.080
Who do you think you are, little maid,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640
to scheme against me?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.120
But given your desperation,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.640
I'll forgive you this once.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
Because of you,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.400
Her Highness antagonizes
Consort Chun further.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.560
Show gratitude!

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.760
My deepest thanks.

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:06.800
Rise.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.920
If the jade orchid dies,

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:15.280
I

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.000
shall charge you severely.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760
Rest assured,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.200
bean residue won't kill it.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.640
I can save it.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.080
You'd better.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.440
Should I fail,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.680
I'll pay with my life.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160
I'll begin at once.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.040
Take the umbrella.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.200
Thank you.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.880
Make haste.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.960
This maid

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.040
shows boldness and wit.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.280
Reminds me of my younger self.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.320
Full of passion

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640
and unflinching resolve.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.960
Now

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.400
after years in these palace walls,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.720
(Yongxiu Palace)
my edges have been worn.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.520
Seeing her

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.720
is like seeing my younger self again.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.880
But Your Highness,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.560
she's so reckless and bold,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.720
full of cunning schemes.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.640
If you keep indulging her,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.240
will she bring disaster upon us?

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.040
Unyielding

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600
yet fiercely loyal.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.720
Such genuine devotion

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.880
is rare treasure in this palace.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.040
Let her stay at Yongxiu Palace.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.680
Discipline her.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.440
I believe

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.520
she

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.360
won't disappoint me.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.760
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.400
When mole crickets gnaw roots,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.080
leaves wilt first before stems rot.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.080
If commoners find these pests in fields,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.160
just boil chinaberry bark

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.120
to drench the roots.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.240
Within three days,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.720
plants will fully recover.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.480
That's reassuring.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.360
I'll present this jade orchid
to His Majesty soon.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.360
Tend it meticulously these coming days.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.920
Yunxiang,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.200
take charge of the greenhouse.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.600
Yes, Your Highness.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.040
I'll care for the jade orchid
with utmost diligence.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.920
Jiuning, you're so knowledgeable!

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.920
Indeed.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.200
Even Xiao Zhuozi, our flower expert,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.800
didn't notice the rotten roots.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.640
This orchid's meant for His Majesty.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.920
You've all been so cautious,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.200
even with the soil,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.600
so you wouldn't know.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.080
You troublemaker.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.240
The infestation

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.280
happened because of her!

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
Yet you praise her?

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.400
Since when do you side with outsiders?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.760
Her Highness ordered me

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.520
to oversee this.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.880
Go sweep outside.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.400
You aren't needed here.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.640
Yunxiang,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.600
we all serve Her Highness.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.200
Jiuning will mend her ways.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.560
She schemed against Her Highness
and nearly doomed us all!

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.720
Have you forgotten so soon?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.160
If she tampers with
the greenhouse again,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.280
I can't take the fall!

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.680
From this day,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.280
all of you must ensure

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800
she stays out of the greenhouse.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.160
Not a single step near the jade orchid.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.720
Any mishap would doom us all

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.600
and implicate Her Highness.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.960
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.712
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.280
Jiuning.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.120
Greetings, Lord Ning.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.360
I heard

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.600
you destroyed
Noble Consort Xian's orchid,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.640
and

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.520
almost got

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.000
your hands chopped off

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.000
by Consort Chun.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.040
You keep risking your life.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.760
Should I call you lucky or blessed?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.640
You jest, Lord Ning.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.760
I don't wish to court danger either.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.480
At first I thought you were merely bold,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.080
but you dare anything

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.320
beyond imagination.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.440
Ruthless enough to use anyone.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.840
Speaking of which,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.000
about that time you used me

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.800
to deliver the portrait,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.440
how do you plan

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
to repay this favor?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.640
Stop teasing, Lord Ning.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.280
I wasn't using you.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.680
You saw my desperation,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.520
stepped forward,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.664
and offered help.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.848
Even now,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.240
hearing I damaged
Noble Consort Xian's orchid,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.840
you kindly sent this new plant

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.640
to spare me punishment.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.440
That's so noble of you.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.600
My gratitude, Lord Ning.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.440
This Golden Hairpin Orchid

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.040
was specially acquired for my enjoyment.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.520
A prized variety,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.240
leaves like swords,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.440
blooms as hairpins.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.200
Then Your Highness
should admire it properly.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.600
Why are you carrying it
to Yongxiu Palace?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.640
Your Highness,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.920
you rushed

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.600
to Dowager Consort's palace to get this

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.080
after you learned Ms. Lu

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.240
destroyed Noble Consort Xian's orchids.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.320
Although

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.440
you're now serving at Yongxiu Palace,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.840
you've already

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.360
become Consort Chun's sworn enemy.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.000
Consort Chun holds immense power.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.440
Her family's military achievements

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.360
have earned His Majesty's trust.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.600
She's not someone you can topple

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.800
with petty tricks

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.520
or minor leverage.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.320
Thank you for the reminder.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.400
It seems you know a lot about
how to stay alive in here.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.760
But my fate is in my own hands.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.680
I don't believe power can eliminate

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.080
all of us normal people.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.400
Now that you're in the eye of the storm,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.440
you must be cautious from now on.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.920
Your Highness.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.720
Your Highness?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.880
Your Highness?

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.400
Your Highness!

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.880
Has Miss Jiuning put some spell on you?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.240
Why do you act so strangely around her?

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.800
I'm not under spell.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.080
It's just that

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.400
I truly

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.400
admire her.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.200
Her fearless spirit

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.600
and defiance of conventions

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.240
are unlike anything I've ever seen.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.960
Before,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.440
I underestimated her.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.120
Why can't I see these supposed virtues?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.800
(Imperial Study)

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.280
Your Majesty's stroke
grows more vigorous.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.400
I've recently copied scriptures,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.440
thinking of presenting them
to Empress Dowager

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.600
upon her return.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.120
Speaking of Her Majesty,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.800
it reminds me of
Talented Lady Wan's tragedy

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.520
after the birthday banquet.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.720
That day, Talented Lady Wan's present

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.600
should've been sleeping sachets,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.840
but turned out to be
spirit money instead.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.000
Talented Lady Wan was gentle

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.280
and meticulous in her duties.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.120
She'd never curse Her Majesty.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.880
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.520
The incident was

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.840
truly suspicious.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.200
Yet Consort Chun

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.960
accused Talented Lady Wan of disrespect

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.800
and confined her to Cold Palace.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.040
Then came news of her suicide.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.200
It's deeply unsettling.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.480
Consort Chun's family
defends the borders

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.680
and had just won.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600
To maintain their morale,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.000
I couldn't pursue this matter.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.720
Understood.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.320
Your Majesty's truly thoughtful.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.280
Your Majesty,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.880
Consort Chun brings loquat syrup.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.080
Send her in.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.880
At once.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.800
Your Majesty.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.960
Rise.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.600
I heard of Your Majesty's cough,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.880
so I prepared loquat syrup

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.520
to soothe your throat.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.040
That's very thoughtful.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.320
Your Majesty,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880
I made this just for you.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.560
It should be taken warm,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.560
lest it turns cold.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.200
Your Majesty,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.680
I must tend to my orchids

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.560
and take my leave now.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.240
Go ahead.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.920
Your Highness.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.440
I've heard

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.880
you cultivated precious jade orchid

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.320
and gifted it to His Majesty.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.120
Pleased by this,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.760
His Majesty bestowed rare flowers

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.680
including a unique

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.760
Yaohuang peony,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.440
called 'Golden Thread Crown.'

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.400
Indeed.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.080
His Majesty's so thoughtful.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.840
I'm truly envious.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.240
The Yaohuang peony

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.400
is the realm's treasure.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.560
The only one specimen

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.280
was gifted to Noble Consort Xian.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.520
If I come across a finer specimen,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680
I shall gift it to you.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.720
Thank you.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.760
However, this flower
is exceedingly rare.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.760
Your Majesty, how about this?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.320
Her Majesty will return from
the mountain retreat in a few days.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.880
Let us take this opportunity

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.240
to host a flower banquet
at Yongxiu Palace.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.160
Splendid idea.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.040
The palace has lacked
such festivity for too long.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.200
I will

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.560
leave it to you.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.880
All shall attend to admire
the blossoms then.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920
Understood.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.120
I will devote utmost care
to this banquet.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.040
Now I'll take my leave.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
(Noble Consort Xian,)

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.400
(a flawless banquet is merely expected.)

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.440
(But any mishap)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.600
(shall become your doom.)

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.160
Place it here.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.840
Gently.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.760
Set it down here.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.640
Give it here.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.760
Careful!

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.000
Polish this area thoroughly.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.920
Slow and careful!

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.200
I've put it here.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.800
Hmm.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.120
Your Highness.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.280
Peonies in tender spring air

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.800
pale before the golden bloom.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.360
I have heard

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.240
commoners once queued with coins

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.320
just to glimpse the Yaohuang peony.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480
Now seeing it myself,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.000
it truly is the king of flowers.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.920
A peerless rarity indeed!

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.120
Your Highness,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.600
this is the only one specimen,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.840
truly priceless.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.160
His Majesty gifted it to you

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.640
because he favors you much.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.520
Moreover, His Majesty ordered
Imperial Household Department

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.600
to deliver other blossoms

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.000
to add to the splendor.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.360
His Majesty entrusted me
to host this event

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.520
for the ladies to marvel at this wonder.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.760
We shall need your assistance.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.880
This...

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.680
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.680
I shall greet the Empress Dowager.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.680
Yunxiang will be in charge here.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.880
Execute your duties meticulously.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Not a single error will be tolerated.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.840
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.720
We bid Your Highness farewell.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.120
Eunuch Liu, this way please.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.520
Very well.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.160
Low-born wretches
truly can't keep favor.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:55.880
Tsk!

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.960
We might all be implicated
in their downfall!

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.760
(Xiao Fuhai?)

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.520
I've warned you to

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.040
stay away from the greenhouse.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.120
What do you want?

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.920
If our banquet fails,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.040
we'll all be doomed.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.040
Now scram!

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.672
Indeed.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:33.960
Your Highness.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.760
All done?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.120
Yes,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.560
I've bought a minor eunuch.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.640
He'll mix alum stones

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880
into all flowerpots.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.880
When watered,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.320
the alum will react,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.760
triggering a scorching boil

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.320
that destroys all blooms.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.680
Excellent.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.400
Damaging the Yaohuang peony

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.880
and ruining the banquet

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.280
will bring the entire
Yongxiu Palace down.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.800
That maid Lu Jiuning

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.200
won't escape either.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
Your Highness is right.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.000
That Lu Jiuning

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.680
thinks she's untouchable

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.440
in Yongxiu Palace

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.200
with Noble Consort Xian's favor.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.840
But

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.080
today is the day she dies.
