(I'm Willing To Be a Lapdog)

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.160
Quit dawdling around.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.560
Hurry up.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.120
Jiuning, let me help you.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.880
Do a proper job.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.560
Look lively.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.640
And keep your wits about you.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.400
If anything goes wrong,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.440
and the superiors blame us,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.320
you'll pay with your worthless lives.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.936
You.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.840
Scrub it clean.

00:00:58.144 --> 00:00:58.720
Yes.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.320
- Yes.
- And this.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.360
This.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.760
Madam Li.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.600
Well, Eunuch Yong.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.040
By the Imperial Household's order,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.160
we need some servants

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.880
to move tributes at Fengxian Hall.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.960
A few days ago,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.840
we sent someone

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.640
to inform you.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.640
I wonder

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.640
if you

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.000
have made proper arrangements?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
These past few days,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280
the imperial kitchen
needed servants for banquets,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.800
and Manufacturing Bureau

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.400
also demanded servants.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.480
Well,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.760
we're short-handed.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.280
Eunuch Yong,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.760
you'd better look elsewhere for help.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.840
Hold on,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.720
Madam Li,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.360
transporting tributes
is of utmost importance.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.000
If it gets delayed,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.560
won't my head roll?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.320
Madam,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.760
here's a small token of my appreciation.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.640
Could you do me a favor?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.160
If your head rolls,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.800
what's that to me?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.200
Don't you know the rules?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.480
For life-threatening tasks like this,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.680
you need ample silver for bribes.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200
Only then can things be done properly.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.320
With this measly amount,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.240
you expect me to obey?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.800
Madam,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm merely

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.576
a minor overseer.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160
I truly can't produce more silver.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120
That's not my concern.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.800
No silver?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.480
Forget about your duties.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680
Fail your duties,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680
and your wretched life

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.280
isn't worth keeping.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.800
Madam Li.

00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:35.680
Madam Li.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.320
How dare you!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.960
You dare disrespect me?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.400
Madam,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.200
look, there's a pit ahead.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.960
Don't sprain your delicate foot.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.440
That's more like it.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.120
Next time, remember

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.400
to bring more silver.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.160
Now go pick some eunuchs
to carry the tributes.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.000
Thank you, Madam Li.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.920
Unbelievable.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.800
Eunuch Yong.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Eunuch Yong, please wait.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.080
Jiuning?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.920
What is it?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.480
You're the head
of the Imperial Household Department.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.720
Madam Li should be subordinate to you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.880
and follow your orders.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.640
But now she holds the world in contempt,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.680
even her superiors.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.960
She openly emptied your purse

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.080
and even humiliated you.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.720
Eunuch Yong,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.080
you really know
how to bend over backwards.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.400
Miss Jiuning,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.600
are you here to mock me?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.360
I merely

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.720
wish to voice

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.280
your injustice.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.440
Very well.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.880
Since your first day in the palace,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.280
we've known each other.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.200
We're old acquaintances now.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.680
I'll share my true thoughts

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.880
with you.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.680
I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.880
have long disliked her.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.120
A mere overseer of the Hard-Labor Ward,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.320
she dared publicly

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.640
give me a hard time.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.440
She has no respect for me at all.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:24.720
That filthy wretch

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.400
flaunts Lady Yu's backing behind her.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.280
I'm just tolerating her for now.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.320
When will

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.080
this humiliating life ever end?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.400
I have a plan to eliminate Madam Li.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.200
I wonder if you'd dare to try it.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.720
As a lowly palace maid,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.720
you're audacious.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.760
If these words

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.200
were overheard by others,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.600
it'd cost your worthless life.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.760
Don't panic.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.160
I'd not suggest it

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.360
without certainty.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.960
Should anything go wrong,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.560
I'll take full responsibility.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.200
You won't be implicated.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
What do you want

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.360
from me?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.400
My request

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.320
is well within your capabilities.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.040
If I overthrow Madam Li,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.800
please arrange

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.200
to make me the new overseer
of the Hard-Labor Ward.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.560
From then on,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.160
I'll follow your every command.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.320
Deal?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.584
(Hard-Labor Ward)

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.960
Madam?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.480
Madam.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.400
Madam.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.000
I need to ask you

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.240
for a favor.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.360
You offended Lady Yu.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240
Begging me won't help.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.352
What's this?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.640
I can't

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.560
endure scrubbing nightsoil pots
day and night anymore.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.520
But I've no money

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.880
except

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.360
this gold-thread handkerchief.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.920
I offer it

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.880
as tribute to you.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.800
No wonder you were once favored
in the palace.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.840
Even a random trinket

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.840
is worth substantial silver.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.680
But I can't accept

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.040
anything from you.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.600
Recently,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.680
you chased away

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.440
the eunuch collecting debts for me.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.720
Weren't you boasting

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.000
that here,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
you fear no one?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880
That was my past foolish arrogance.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.680
Madam,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.760
please don't hold it against me.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.440
Look,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.776
this handkerchief's

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.200
threads are pure gold.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.320
Look.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.200
The embroidery.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800
The stitching precision.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.040
I only appreciate two types of dogs.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.800
The first

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.680
kneels and licks my feet,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040
a lapdog.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.840
The second

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.760
is the kind

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.080
that yaps mindlessly,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.960
a stray mutt.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.960
Tell me,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.120
which dog are you?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.360
I'll be your lapdog,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.720
serving at your side.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.840
Wise choice.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.920
In the Hard-Labor Ward,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.360
I'm the almighty Buddha.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.680
No matter who you are,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.200
none escape

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
my palm.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.240
Now,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.480
crawl.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.760
Let me see it.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.080
Well done.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.560
Since you're so obedient,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
tomorrow you'll wash clothes

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.080
instead of scrubbing nightsoil pots.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.800
Thank you, Madam.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.800
Off you go.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.760
(Madam Li,)

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.360
(gluttonous snakes choke on elephants.)

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080
(Tomorrow)

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.440
(will be your doom.)

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.480
Good morning, Madam.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.080
You seem particularly cheerful today.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.560
Has some happy occasion befallen you?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.960
Lady Yu summoned me
for a chat at He'an Palace.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.520
How's my outfit?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.320
Is it appropriate?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.960
Wisdom and elegance
blend perfectly within you, Madam.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.560
No matter what you wear,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.000
it always showcases
your impeccable taste.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.680
You certainly know
how to flatter, Xiaoyu.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.040
In the future,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.600
I'll need to rely on your guidance.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.880
Well, well.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.960
Are you Chief Eunuchs
of the Manufacturing Bureau

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.800
and the Imperial Household Department?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.960
What brings you

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.880
to this wretched Hard-Labor Ward?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.040
Everyone, cease your tasks.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.400
Assemble all servants in the courtyard.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
What's happening?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.160
No idea.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.600
What's it?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.320
What happened?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.280
No idea.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.600
Well.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.520
Eunuch Shun,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.480
well...

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.200
what exactly is the matter?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.048
Manufacturing Bureau's
Embroidery Workshop

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.000
has lost the embroidery intended
as an imperial gift for a consort.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.400
An informant claims

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.880
it was stolen by someone
from Hard-Labor Ward.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.880
Impossible.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880
How could that be?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.320
Daring to steal imperial property?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.760
Who has such audacity?

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.200
Confess now.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.960
If I have to uncover it myself,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.960
heads will roll.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.560
Heavens above.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.280
How could that happen?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.520
Which Hard-Labor Ward member

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.160
would dare steal

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.120
from the Embroidery Workshop?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.240
This is impossible.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.000
Well...

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.920
Madam Li,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.120
your boldness knows no bounds.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.280
This handkerchief in your hand

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.440
is the stolen item.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.520
What? It's stolen?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.600
Is that true?

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.440
It can't be.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.320
Could Madam Li have stolen it?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.000
This handkerchief uses golden thread,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.320
fireworm silk, and peacock plume thread,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.120
three rare materials in total,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.240
and the kesi silk
tapestry technique to craft.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.800
It took ten master embroiderers

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.640
three months
to complete this single piece.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.640
How dare you

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.920
use such a precious artifact?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.760
You've truly tired of living.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.360
I'm innocent.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.160
I'm truly innocent.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.040
Wait.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.480
It was Lu Jiuning.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.640
It was her.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.320
She gave me this handkerchief.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.600
Yes, it was her.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.640
You're the real thief.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.400
Would she dare?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.320
Exactly.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
Your Excellency,

00:11:30.496 --> 00:11:32.440
I'm serving punishment
in the Hard-Labor Ward.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.880
I couldn't possibly have left.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.080
How could I steal
from the Embroidery Workshop?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.320
Stop lying.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.840
Last night, you offered me
this handkerchief, you vile wretch.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.680
You...

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.840
you vile wretch!

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.720
How dare you...

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.360
How dare you frame me!

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.040
Madam Li, at this point,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.680
you still deny it?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.360
Not even Lady Yu

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.880
could save you now.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.560
What?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.520
Don't you know what I want?

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.600
Jiuning,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.840
I beg you.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.320
I beg you, spare me.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.600
I'll tell you

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
what you want to know.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720
Everything.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.400
When Wan'er was in the Cold Palace,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.600
were you delivering her meals?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.200
Yes.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.040
It was me.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.480
It was me.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.680
You want

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.200
to know what happened

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.360
to her in the Cold Palace that day?

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.240
I'll talk.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.840
I'll tell everything.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.880
That day...

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.680
That day, Lady Yu

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.120
went to see her.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.760
I remember

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.760
I delivered the meal

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.880
to the Cold Palace.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.480
When I brought it in,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.160
I saw Talented Lady Wan.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.280
She appeared completely normal then.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.760
After a while,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.160
Lady Yu entered.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.760
Later,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880
she came out.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.640
After that, Talented Lady Wan

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.400
committed suicide

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.400
out of guilt.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.200
So it was her.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440
Why must Lady Yu

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.360
kill Wan'er?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.240
I don't know.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.440
I don't know.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840
I only helped frame her
into the Cold Palace.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.480
Lady Yu

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.680
didn't let me know anything else.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.720
Jiuning, I beg you.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.800
I beg you

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.720
to spare my wretched life.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.480
Your Excellency, you may not know,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.360
but Madam Li

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.080
has been embezzling funds
in the Hard-Labor Ward

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.200
and is utterly greedy.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.760
Countless palace staff suffered.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.920
About whether
she stole this handkerchief,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.640
just go to her quarters

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.160
and search thoroughly,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680
and the truth will surface.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.440
Someone.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.880
Search.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800
- Yes.
- You wretch.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.024
Your Excellency,

00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:58.280
we found the late empress'

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.360
lost ceremonial robe.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.600
The late empress' ceremonial robe?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.800
You...

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.200
You vile wretch!

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.160
Madam Li,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.080
possessing belongings

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.800
of the late empress

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.440
is a capital offense.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680
Dare you deny it?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.640
Madam Li,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.720
you've been insolent daily,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.880
greedy, and tyrannical.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.120
Today,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.800
you commit this treasonous act.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.480
No one can save you now.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.960
I'm innocent.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960
I'm innocent.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.440
This...

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.120
this robe

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.600
was given by Manufacturing Bureau
eunuchs to repay debts.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.240
Outrageous!

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.640
You insolent wretch,

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.400
you hid the empress' robe

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.400
and slander us,
the Manufacturing Bureau.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.320
Guards.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.960
Strip her of the Hard-Labor Ward
overseer position.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.360
Drag her away,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.320
beat her

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.240
to break her limbs,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.560
and dump her in a death cell.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.280
No.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.920
I'm innocent.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.120
Move.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120
I'm framed.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.240
I swear I'm innocent.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.560
I'm innocent.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.920
I swear I'm innocent.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.920
Hard-Labor Ward maid Lu Jiuning,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.200
for meritorious exposure,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.000
is appointed Hard-Labor Ward overseer
effective immediately.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.360
I pledge diligent service,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.000
honoring Your Excellency's
and Eunuch Yong's trust.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.120
(Wan'er,)

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.680
(evil begets retribution.)

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.120
(Madam Li, who harmed you,)

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.000
(has finally paid in blood.)

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.400
(Next,)

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.360
(I'll bring Lady Yu before you)

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.960
(to beg your forgiveness.)
