00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.310
Thank you.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.870
Any new leads?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.360
No.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.870
These cases

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.400
have no connection
to that rape-murder case.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.360

Taihua Restaurant
and West Taihua Restaurant

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.710
are actually owned by the same person.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.680
So the owner
often travels between the two.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.430
But the restaurants are too far apart,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.550
so their customers

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.980
probably don't overlap.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.660
But guess what I found.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.600
Are you very thirsty?

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.270
Finish your words.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.070
I found two people who frequently appear

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.840
at both restaurants
in their account books.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.470
Look.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.970
This is Salesman Wang.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.590
He often goes to these 2 restaurants

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.120
to sell his tape recorders.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.220
And Mr. Dong—

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.030
he's a rickshaw puller.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.960
But he also frequently goes
to these 2 restaurants.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.960
A rickshaw puller
can afford a meal at Taihua?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
Yeah, I wonder about that too.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.040
What's more,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.710
after this case happened,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.170
this person never appeared again.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.770
We need to focus our investigation
on these 2 people.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.150
Tomorrow, you'll go with me to Taihua.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.080
You go to Director Huo

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.030
and see if there are any other files

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.150
related to the rape-murder case.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.560
Okay.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.890
Brew 10 cups of coffee for me.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.430
Ten cups?

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.910
I'm worried you won't be able to sleep.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.890
Can't you recognize my voice?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.550
Du Linfeng, what do you want?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.300
I'll pick you up later.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.330
Pick me up for what? I'm at work.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.360
Do you have something important?
If not, I'm hanging up.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.920
No, wait! I'll pick you up for dinner.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.180
It's so late. You can't starve yourself.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.680
Can you please stop worrying about me?

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.220
I'm perfectly fine on my own.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.600
Let's just go to Yuenan Restaurant
for a bowl of congee to warm your stomach.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.390
You need to eat

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.250
to have the energy to work, right?

and baby's breath.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.600
a bit of mystery in front of you.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.680

It's just that

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.380
there's no place for you here,

The Intelligence Department

previously had no relation to us.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.370
We barely had any contact.

Yes.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.600
Originally, I wanted to wait for you
to come back

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.330
to handle
the Logistics Armed Team matter first.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.250
I had no choice.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.790
The higher-ups need someone they trust.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.850
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
specifically sent me to study for 2 years.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.700
Don't mind me nagging.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.980
You're not young anymore.
It's time to settle down.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.150
But in my territory,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.630
shouldn't you keep a lower profile?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.550
Pursuing a girl is fine.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.390
It won't affect you anyway.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.510
The higher-ups value you.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.030
But Lu just started working here,

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:07.870
right?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.890
She's capable.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.440
Others are already jealous of her.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.000
This is exactly the time
she needs to keep a low profile.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.060
Such a spectacle you made isn't good.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.140
It reached your ears so quickly?

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.690
Well,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.750
I saw those flowers

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.960
placed in the office.
How could I not know?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.890

Okay, Mr. Huo. I'll listen to you.

Alright. Go on then.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.280

It's a pity

Nice to meet you, Dr. Ding.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.720
Director Du, as expected of someone
from the Intelligence Department.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.580
You're also impressive, Dr. Ding,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.720
knowing who I am
without having met me before.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.620
Your reputation precedes you, Director Du.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.510
Plus,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.530
after what you did at the Police Station,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.930
it's hard not to know you.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.630
We never had the chance to meet before.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.720
Let me formally introduce myself today.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.580
I'm Du Linfeng.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.510
Looking forward to working with you.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.330
You seem to be in quite good spirits.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.240
You don't look like someone

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.690
who was just rejected.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.970
Relationships are never smooth sailing.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.080
A small suggestion for you.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.090
Milk destroys the coffee's inherent aroma,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.390
especially its acidity.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.800
The beans here

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.280
are all lightly roasted,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.280
which preserves
the coffee's original flavor

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.670
and those floral and fruity notes
to the maximum extent,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.150
especially
that quality and distinct acidity.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.080
Since you want to taste the acidity,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.720
why add sugar?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.700
Isn't that contradictory?

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.920
It seems contradictory, but it's not.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.480
Sugar can instantly open up your palate

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.280
and heighten your sensitivity.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.300
In other words,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.280
adding sugar
is to better appreciate the acidity.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.490
But I think

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.070
adding sugar

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.430
ruins the coffee's purity and mouthfeel.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.540
The sugar, to this cup of coffee,

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.790
is like

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.160
those roses to you just now—

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.100
utterly superfluous.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.200
Dr. Ding,
you have a deep misunderstanding of sugar.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:56.960
It seems

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.650
you've drunk quite a few cups of coffee

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.300
ruined by sugar before.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.740
When I was young and naive,
I didn't know how to appreciate things.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.340
It's common
to drink a few cups of awful coffee.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:05.910
Indeed.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.970
Who can know their own taste preferences
from the start?

You've scared all my customers away.

You can also ask my parents at my place.

you can ask the neighbors.

if you solve the case
and find the murderer,

will you still arrest me?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.830
If you haven't committed a crime,
why would we arrest you?

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.610
Maybe the criminal is very hard to catch,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.130
or you want to close the case quickly,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.280

I doubt that.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.720
As long as you commit a crime,

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.580
Over there. Right ahead.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.060
What about there?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.260
-She's here!
-She's here!

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.660
She's here!

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.270
She's here! She's here!

00:19:59.400 --> 00:19:59.920
Hello.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.830
What's your view

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.200
on the current rumors
about the Police Station?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.060
Please tell us.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.720
Share your thoughts, okay?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.550
Say something.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.110
About the Police Station.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.990
-Say something.
-Say something.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.550
I'm a reporter
from The Republican Daily News.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.680
You've got the wrong person.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.810
She's my assistant.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.240
What assistant?

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.960
Isn't she wearing a police uniform?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.550
That's right.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.030
Yes, isn't she from the police station?

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.460
I wanted her
to infiltrate the police station.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.160
But now she hasn't even managed to get in,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.550
and you've already surrounded her here.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.310
Aren't you just wasting our time?

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.310
Let's go.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.040
Let's go.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.640
Thank you.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.170
You're welcome.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.970
It's been a long time since we met.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.500
Let's have a meal together.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.010
I think
I still have some work to do today.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.270
It won't take too much of your time.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.800
Your inspector won't mind.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.310
Why did you come to me?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.810
I simply want to treat you to a meal.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.640
We've known each other for so many years,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.640
yet this is our first meal together.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.480
I was immature before.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.040
I did many bad things.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.300
I hope you won't take them to heart.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.080
Let's not mention the past.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.610
Have you been very busy lately?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.680
Not really.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.620
I understand.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.750
It's the same for us reporters.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.880
Running after news stories every day.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400
At the beginning,

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.440
I couldn't adapt at all.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.070
I couldn't even get enough sleep,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.680
let alone personal time.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.890
We go wherever the news is.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.720
Sometimes, for one story,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.360
we have to stake out for a whole day.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.250
Looking at it that way,

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.050
our jobs are quite similar.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.030
No matter how tired we get,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.150
we still can't compare
to you police officers.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.630
Taihua Restaurant...

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.050
Was Inspector Guan there that day

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.540
investigating the recent 2 scalping cases?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.680
If the suspect isn't the salesman,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.060
who could it be?

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.540
Sorry.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.480
I shouldn't be asking you about this.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:23.740
Thank you

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.270
for getting me out of that situation.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.030
My pleasure.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.660
I've been looking for you.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.640
Hello, Inspector Guan.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.000
Have you finished eating?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.530
Let's go.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.310
I'm leaving then.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.390
I'll see you out.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:53.720
Sorry

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.850
for delaying your investigation.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.530
We're leaving then.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440
Good luck with your investigation.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.400
Regarding this Salesman Wang,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.480
I've asked his family

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.340
and neighbors.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.680
It matches what he said.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.010
We can basically rule him out
as a suspect.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.510
But he disturbed public order

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.750
and slandered us from the police station.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.150
Lock him up for a few days.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.000
Okay.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.940
Any news on Mr. Dong?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.200
Those rickshaw pullers

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.440
we met at Taihua before

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.730
aren't close to Mr. Dong.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.590
They've only seen him a few times.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.400
But he gave me a few addresses.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.400
He said they are places
Mr. Dong frequently stays.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.860
I plan to go check them out.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.920
Okay.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.760
I'll leave Mr. Dong to you then.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.750
The information

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.820
Taihua Restaurant gave us
is still too little.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.750
We don't know their shift schedules

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.550
or who they interact with daily.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.240
We still have to go there again.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.720
Dong.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.160
Meeting adjourned.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.170
Who are you thinking about?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.350
Thinking about me?

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.270
Let me ask you.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.180
What kind of people
love coming to Taihua Restaurant most?

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.540
Foreigners love coming most, right?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.160
What do foreigners love most?

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.440
They love cleanliness the most,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.550
right?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Then look at that thick dust!

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.030
Hurry up and wipe it off!

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.770
Clean the tea caddies too!

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.380
The tea caddy on the right!

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.610
Not there.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.790
Move a bit more to the side!

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.340
I can even see the dust!

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.070
Mr. Li.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.090
Inspector Guan.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.880
It's not that we at Taihua
don't welcome you.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.050
It's just that you've already investigated
what needed to be investigated.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.730
And you've caused a scene.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.830
I can't stop doing business just because

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.690
the deceased worked here, right?

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.480
Mr. Li,

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.650
we are investigating the case

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.000
so that you can do better business here.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.140
If the case isn't solved,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.440
Taihua Restaurant

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.970
will remain
under the shadow of a murder case.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.890
That would be worse for business, right?

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.320
But investigation is your duty.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.520
What can we do?

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.700
We can't just close down
for your investigation.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.850
Taihua Restaurant can't hold on

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.940
till the day you arrest the murderer.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.030
Mr. Li,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.320
I

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.200
just want you to provide

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.660
some useful information.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.980
If the case is solved,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.750
we'll all be happy.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.520
If it's not solved,

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.340
none of us can have it easy.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:47.960
Mr. Li,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.340
show us your shift schedules.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.640
Do you think my arms are that long?

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.830
Then hurry up and hand it over!

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.250
It's all here.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.000
Thank you.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.500
This is the date.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.330
Inspector Guan,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.790
you can take this back
to the Police Station

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.310
and look at it thoroughly.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.030
Yes.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.960
Thank you, Mr. Li.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.240
No big deal.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.440
Mr. Li.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.720
Tell everyone

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.640
our Taihua Restaurant

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.030
doesn't welcome anyone
from the Police Station.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.590
Yes.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.830
Miss, need a ride?

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.440
Not for now.
I'd like to ask you something.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.580
Do you know Mr. Dong?

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.200
Dong?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.900
I haven't seen him for a few days.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920
Do you need him for something, Miss?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.210
I'm from the Police Station.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.650
I want to ask him about something.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.170
What... What did he do?

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.410
No. Just a routine investigation.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.240
If you have any information about him,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.480
you can also report it
to the police station.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:37.920
Okay.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.240
Thank you.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.170
You're welcome.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.350
They're after Dong?

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.000
Have you found him?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.590
Not yet.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.510
And the other rickshaw pullers

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.240
haven't seen him for a few days.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.520
Director Huo.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.850
Inspector Guan,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.310
you're finally back.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.590
Director Huo has been waiting here

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.790
for over an hour.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.770
See for yourselves.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.280
As detailed as if they saw it
with their own eyes.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.440
[A Heinous Murder Case: The Killer
Is Extremely Cruel, Removing All Scalps]

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.200
Such detailed case information

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.510
must have been leaked
from within our own ranks!

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.310
Is this how you handle your work?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.850
Inspector Guan,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.960
how could you be so careless?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.440
You're off this case.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.000
Orders from above:

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.800
investigate yourselves first!

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.570
But we're only
halfway through the investigation.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.020
Dong.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.350
So you know
you're halfway through it, huh?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.950
Since Inspector Zhu is here,

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.930
hand over all the case files to him.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:46.930
Do it now!

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.720
How could you make such a big mistake?

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.760
Inspector Guan,

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.160
I'm really sorry.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.960
It's what the higher-ups wanted.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.640
I really couldn't refuse.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.160
Guofeng.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.820
Inspector.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.240
Work on the handover with Inspector Guan.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.640
Yes.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.270
Why should we hand over a case
we're halfway through

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.170
to someone else?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.310
We're the ones on the front lines usually.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.240
And we're still the ones blamed
when things go wrong.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.410
Inspector Guan.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.160
Well, this...

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.550
Dong.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.750
These are all the files we have here.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.310
Thank you, Inspector Guan.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.920
Wait.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.320
You want to leave with the files
without signing?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.910
Don't bring your bad habits
from the Laozha Patrol Room

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.560
to the Police Station.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.200
Sign it.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.440
Okay.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.400
Is this okay?

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.510
I'm leaving then.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.050
