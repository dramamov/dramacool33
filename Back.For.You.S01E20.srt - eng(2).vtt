00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.720
Only three months left until the college entrance exam.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.320
Whether you work hard or not,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.480
whether you study or not,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.800
the textbooks are right there.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.880
the university is right there.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
Before, I didn't notice it.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.400
Lately, I suddenly feel

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.280
you're a mature kid for your age.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.720
Even though you don't put all your focus

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.680
on studying,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.280
but still,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.440
I can tell

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.200
you have your own ideas.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.440
Right?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.280
Zhang Xun's grades aren't good,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.680
but at least he has the sports school path.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.960
What about you?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.440
I want to ask you,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.120
what do you want to do in the future?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.920
For me,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.400
what the future holds

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.320
is already set in stone.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.280
But I can't tell you that.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.000
As for me,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.480
I want to be a kind person.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.400
There are many successful people in this world.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.880
In our class,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.400
Ren Nan will definitely become a big boss.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.840
The class president will join a top 500 company.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
Hui Ge will do scientific research.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680
Tang Song might become a police officer.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520
And Su Ruo.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.040
Yu Xingchen, long time no see.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.720
Of course,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.240
many people won't have it easy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
Teacher Jiang,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.280
I just hope

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.000
when everyone hits a low point,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.160
I'm not just a cold bystander.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.560
Alright.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.760
That's a wonderful thought.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.040
But if you want to help others,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.920
don't you also need to work hard yourself?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.720
Right now, I simply hope

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.560
everyone can be happy

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.640
and safe.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.720
The future—

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.200
what kind of life you want

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.880
is your own choice.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.840
As long as you don't regret it later.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.960
Teacher Jiang,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.040
life can't be restarted.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.240
But if I had a chance to start over,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.240
I still

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.760
wouldn't deserve another try.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.200
Because I think

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.880
that would be unfair.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.160
I don't feel regret.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.200
I just think some things

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.320
will leave regrets.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.240
What did you say?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.320
Nothing much.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.360
Just told me to work hard

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.040
and not regret my life.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.920
The teacher's right.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.120
We're really leaving school soon.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.360
I can't bear to leave.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.600
I'm okay with it.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.200
I've graduated once before.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.960
You mean middle school?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.480
Yeah.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.000
By the way,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.800
you brought your guitar last night—

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.240
was it to play for me?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.600
So when will you play again?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.520
I want to hear it.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.160
Back to where it all began.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.320
In my memories,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.480
your smile is so sweet.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.480
Your profile under the starry sky.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.880
I got the wrong key.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.720
Sing! I'm recording.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.280
I can't hit that note.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.000
Off-key is even better.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.680
Do another one.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.840
Come on, one more!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.040
Back to where it all began.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.040
Yu Xingchen, not bad!

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.600
So you asked me to teach you guitar

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.960
just to play for Su Ruo.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.480
Ren Nan, what are you doing?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.320
Stop pretending.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.960
Explain yourself.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.560
Are you chasing after Su Ruo?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.560
I'm a little dizzy.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.440
Are you okay?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.120
Alright.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.320
What are you doing?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.600
You're way out of line.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.720
Are you crazy?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.080
Why did you splash water on him?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.000
Because of the medium interference principle.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.160
Did it cause a tunneling effect interruption?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.680
Wasn't he dizzy?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960
I wanted to wake him up.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.840
Ren Nan, what are you doing?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.000
Yu Xingchen.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.040
I'm telling you,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.160
watch your behavior from now on.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520
Don't be a toad lusting after a swan.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.360
This is a warning.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.560
Warning you not to have foolish hopes.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.200
Are you alright?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.960
It's raining, remember to dry your hair when you get home.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.000
Don't catch a cold.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400
Good thing we have two umbrellas this time.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.600
Su Ruo.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.000
Have you been happy these days?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.320
Yes, I have.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.720
Then you

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.960
should always remember these happy moments.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.240
If I'm ever unhappy one day,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.280
I'll come find you.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.880
My ride's here.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.040
I'm heading off.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.280
See you tomorrow.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.480
See you tomorrow.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.720
Even though I haven't changed anything,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.040
at least I made many beautiful memories for her.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.520
That's a good thing, I guess.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.920
Stop sleeping.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.080
Why are you here again?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.360
A friend named Zhang Xun asked you to play ball.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.880
With his leg, he can still play?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.760
He probably just wants a free meal.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.640
Let's go, Ning Jing. I'll treat you to lunch.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.920
Pass the ball! Over here, over here!

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.760
Serve again.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.240
Bro.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.560
Where's your friend?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.600
I'm wondering too.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.560
I didn't see any wheelchair or crutches.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.120
Did we get the wrong place?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.920
Girlfriend, huh?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.200
My little sister.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.080
I'd love to be your brother-in-law.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.920
Is that okay?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.840
Just kidding, sis. Don't take it seriously.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.320
But think about it for real.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.640
Stop joking around.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.720
You don't need a cane anymore.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.320
With my Super Saiyan leg,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.480
why would I need a cane?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.880
Did you forget what happened senior year?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.440
Maybe you should change your shoes.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.040
Those spikes are intense.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.440
You might hurt someone if you kick them.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.960
Zhang Xun.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.520
Get him to the infirmary, quick!

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.760
He has an Achilles tendon rupture.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.480
Don't take him to the infirmary.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.080
Go to the hospital for surgery, now!

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.560
Or he'll be crippled.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680
I'll go with him to the hospital.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.600
You go back to class.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.720
Please remind the doctor,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.560
don't delay the surgery.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.600
He needs an Achilles tendon operation ASAP.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.800
Okay, don't worry.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.240
Let me tell you,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.760
if it weren't for me,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.440
you'd need a cane for the rest of your life.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.160
You know that, right?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.360
You really owe me a thank you.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.840
You still remember stuff from ages ago.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.320
Just say you want a free meal.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.600
After I retired from the provincial team,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.480
the bureau gave us athletes some support.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800
So I started an online shop.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.360
Zhang Xun.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.400
Why did you suddenly want to play ball today?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.400
I ran into someone recently.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.800
It made me think of our high school days.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.200
And I started missing you.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.120
Who did you meet that made you think of high school?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.000
My first love.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.640
Wasn't our first love the same person?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.760
Come on, stop messing around.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.000
Who did you actually meet?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.960
Ren Nan.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.040
He's a big boss at a listed company now.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.280
We haven't talked in years.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.560
What?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.400
You still mind when I mention Ren Nan?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.960
Why would I mind?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.680
Mind him splashing water in my face?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.680
It's always a femme fatale.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.240
Getting jealous over Su Ruo.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.480
Su Ruo.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.640
So her name was Su Ruo.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.760
I need to tell my sister about this.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.440
Su Ruo...

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.040
She could've totally been your sister-in-law.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.440
Listen up, everyone.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.360
Hosting the radio station all this time,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.920
I've dedicated songs for many teachers and classmates.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.560
But today's first song

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.640
is for my own eighteenth birthday.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.000
I also want to dedicate it to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.960
all senior year teachers and students.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.720
No matter the outcome,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.360
at least we've all tried our best.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.280
And also,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.760
I want to say to Zhang Xun from Class Three,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.440
get well soon.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.240
Everyone in Class Three is waiting for you.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.080
Su Ruo's last broadcast.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.480
Weren't you having surgery at that time?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.960
I didn't record it.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.680
Ren Nan played it for me a few days ago.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.240
I asked him for a copy.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.680
Thinking back, those days were really nice.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.840
A recording from fifteen years ago.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.520
Ren Nan kept it all this time.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.440
Does he still like Su Ruo?

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.880
You two are both pretty devoted.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.960
Isn't my brother still single too?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.000
If Su Ruo were still single,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
wouldn't there still be a chance?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.600
In this lifetime,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.440
I'm afraid none of us have a chance.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.840
I'll punish myself, I will.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.240
Zhang Xun.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.160
How did you get in touch with Ren Nan?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.880
Not long ago,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.800
I went for a massage at the physiotherapy clinic where Su Ruo used to work.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.160
I ran into Ren Nan there.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.240
I said hi.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.400
At first,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.280
he ignored me.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.680
So I went right up to him.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.920
Gave him a slap like this—

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.560
right on his head.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.480
He looked at me and said,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.440
he said,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.760
"Zhang Xun, long time no see."

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.480
After that,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.600
we had a meal together.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
We both got pretty drunk.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.520
He passed out.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.880
His driver and I carried him to the car.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.440
After we got in, the driver asked,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.680
Boss,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.880
where are we going?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.440
Ren Nan said,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.480
"Home."

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.120
The driver asked again,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.840
Boss, which home do you mean?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.480
Listen to that.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.240
Sis, which home do you think?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.560
What does that mean?

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.120
Isn't it obvious?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.960
He sure has plenty of places to stay.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.400
Exactly.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.200
The driver asked several times.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.520
Ren Nan didn't answer.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.960
So I looked over,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.520
he was already asleep.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.880
The driver started to panic.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.960
He looked at the two of us,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.240
thought we were close buddies.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.880
Scratching his head, he asked me where to go.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.160
I thought, how would I know?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.440
But I didn't think too much about it.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.840
Just figured he had lots of homes.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.000
So I said, just go to whichever is closest.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.920
So the driver got the order,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.720
and drove straight to Jianshe Community.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.360
So he went to Jianshe Community?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.480
So he went to Jianshe Community?
