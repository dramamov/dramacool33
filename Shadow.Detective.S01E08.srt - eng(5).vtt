00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.560
Yes, we did have dinner together.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.770
But I absolutely did not reveal
any information!

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.680
She had dinner with you
and then wrote that article.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.000
Do you seriously think
that was just a coincidence?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.240

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.070
You think I'm the mole?

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.230
How could I possibly leak...

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.030
Calm down.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.000
If you didn't do it,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.430
I believe the truth will come to light.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.530
But if the higher-ups come...

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.240

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.600

Given the circumstances,
is it really appropriate

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.410
not to suspend and detain her?

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.050
She's your subordinate.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.920
Aren't you going to take a stand?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.780
We've all worked in the police force
for many years.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.940
You should know very well

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.400
that everything requires evidence, right?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.350
To be honest,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.960
I also

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.640
ran into Wu Xiaoxiao at noon that day.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.830
Does that mean

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.620
I could have leaked information too?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.150
If the higher-ups have
any evidence proving

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.030
that someone from
our Shanghai Police Station is involved,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.550
I'll follow protocol.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.080
If not,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.480
we should continue working as usual.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.790
After all, at the Shanghai Police Station,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.750
things still need to be done

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.720
according to my rules, right?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.790
So by that logic,

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.630

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.160

Come with me to try it?

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.380
But Director Huo...

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.610
Alright, come on.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.600
Come on, come on.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.840
Get back to work.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.620

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.600

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.200
For what?

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.670
Thank you for standing up for me.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.960
I was just being responsible
for my officers.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.160
I wasn't helping you.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.430
I've been thinking back.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.910
That day, Wu Xiaoxiao

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.630
was indeed trying to probe into
our investigation details.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.090
I didn't reveal anything,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.750
but

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.790
it's true that I had dinner with her.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.380
I've caused trouble for everyone.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:13.980
I'm sorry.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.000
You don't need to explain anymore.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.130
Everything must be based on evidence.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.720
You don't need to
worry about this matter anymore.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.550
I'll handle it.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.410
Go back to work.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.250
That Wu Xiaoxiao

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.550
really is a leopard
that can't change its spots.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.240
Lu Yizhen,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.090
someone's looking for you
at the reception desk!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.240
Find out who it is for me.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.640
Got it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.720
What?

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.510
Not happy to see me?

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.360
I don't have time
to talk to you right now.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.320
Lu Yizhen.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.670
Don't tell me you're still upset about

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.070
that article in The Republican Daily News.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200
How did you know?

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.480
I know everything that happens
in the International Settlement.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.870
Those two cases we were working on
have been handed over

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.330
to the Laozha Patrol Room.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.770
Everyone worked so hard on those cases.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.080
We finally made some progress,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.220
but then everyone got dragged down
because of me.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.620
I feel terrible about it.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.510
What did he say?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.720
Guan Cen?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.460
He's strictly impartial.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.590
That sounds like him.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.910
But you know,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.550
Inspector Zhu is quite skilled at
taking credit for others' work.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.270
For all these years,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.150
your Shanghai Police Station
has always outranked him.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.870
So once he sees an opening,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.400
of course, he'll push hard.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.980
So now that you know all this,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.840
you need to adapt to these things.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
After all, a job

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.000
isn't just about the job itself.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.440
I'm definitely going to find Wu Xiaoxiao

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.500
and clear things up.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.270
What's the point of finding her?

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.360
Someone like her

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.460
won't admit anything,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.860
even if you confront her.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.030
Maybe she wanted you to
take the blame all along.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.750
But why?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.720
Alright, Lu Yizhen.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.760
These things aren't worth your concern.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.070
Fresh out of the oven.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.510
Thank you.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.600
Trust me,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.240
this will all blow over.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.570
I wonder how those two cases are going.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.360
That's none of your concern anymore.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.960
But we worked so hard on them.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.980
Can't we even show a little concern?

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.360
Dong,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.030
deliver this

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.290
to the Laozha Patrol Room
with Lu Yizhen.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.360
Stop punching. Take a break.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.510
Don't tell me
you dragged me out here this late

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.240
just to watch you hit a sandbag.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.750
Did someone bully you?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.160
No.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.200
No...

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.900
Then...

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.670
Having trouble at work?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.080
No.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.750
Not that either.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.440
I know what it is.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.950
You failed to submit your novel on time?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.520
I finished it.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.840
Then what is it?

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.160
You don't seem like yourself.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.800
You're not secretly seeing some guy
behind my back, are you?

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.550
No way! If you're dating someone,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.720
you have to tell me!

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.400
I need to vet the guy for you!

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.360
Whose son is he?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.080
Is he tall?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.120
Is he handsome?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.520
Is he good enough for you?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.020
Dr. Gu...

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.120
Dr. Gu?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.030
Yizhen, it's you.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.450
How do you have time to come over today?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.550
Yes.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.720
I might have more free time lately.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.250
Then, have a seat. Sit.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.880
Let me get you some water.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.480
Here.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.480
Have some water.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.150
Thank you.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.840
You officers

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.240
rarely get any downtime.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.030
Our cases have been

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.720
handed over to the Laozha Patrol Room,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.120
so things will be a bit easier
for us lately.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.870
Why?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.600
If it's inconvenient to say, I won't ask.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.300
No.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.790
It's because I'm suspected of
leaking case details.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.480
So...

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.380
That happened?

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.210
That won't affect your work, will it?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.950
There is some impact.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:58.840
But...

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.110
It's okay.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.600
That's good.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.040
I believe you wouldn't do such a thing.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.480
Since there's no major impact,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.960
why do you seem so down?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.190
After taking the sedative medicine,

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.590
are you sleeping better?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.870
I can fall asleep now.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:19.850
That's good.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.270
Dr. Gu.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.080
I still want you to help me
recover my memories.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.690
You should know that...

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.600
there might be something in those memories

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.150
that you cannot bear.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.320
Or rather,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.930
you might see a completely
unfamiliar version of yourself.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.760
Are you really sure about this?

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.840
I'm sure.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.280
I don't want to run away anymore.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.350
All right.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.750
I can face it with you.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.150
Are you all right?

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.530
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.750
I'm getting old,
and my eyesight isn't good.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.810
I'll go bandage it.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.770
Have some water first!

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.330
Inspector.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:35.790
Here.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.530
Thank you for your help.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.870
She's really like a child.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.960
All her thoughts are written on her face.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.390
What?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.270
I said

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.940
the weather is nice today.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.430
Love might be
in the air for you, Inspector.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.550
I'm off.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.440
Come on, guys!

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.750
Let's see what the inspector brought us!

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.410
Dong, what goodies did he get?

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.490
Marron glacé.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.480
Inspector Guan bought them
especially for us!

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:18.829
Here.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.690
Try some.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.829
Come on, dude!

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.849
Have some candy.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
Come on, Lu Yizhen! Have some candy!

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:27.829
What candy?

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:28.990
Marron glacé.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.370
Inspector Guan went all the way
to Yufei Road to buy them.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.060
Running that far early in the morning.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.270
Maybe he didn't even go home
last night, huh?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.160
Right?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.830
Yeah.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.310
Come on, share with the guys.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.200
Alright. Have some.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.770
Come on. Let's share. Share them.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.290
Come on! Try some. It's delicious!

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.400
As if I can't afford them myself.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.970
What's there to show off about?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.630
What's gotten into you today?

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.400
I'm fine.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.340
I'll answer it.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.280
Shanghai Police Station,
this is Lu Yizhen.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:07.940
This is she.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.760
What's wrong?

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.370
They're going to question me
internally tomorrow.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.160
You're so unlucky.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.960
I'm really unlucky.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.200
But they can't just

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.550
accuse you of leaking information

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.880
without any evidence.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.600
Lu Yizhen!

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.170
Come with me.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.090
Where are we going?

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.390
Laozha Patrol Room.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.490
Laozha Patrol Room?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.550
Go, go, go.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.790
Let's go. Come on.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.920
-Let's go!
-Come on.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.070
No matter what difficulties you face
in the coming days,

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.480
you must overcome them all.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:01.960
Yes.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.790
Inspector Guan.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.080
What do you mean by this?

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.030
Inspector Zhu, I'd like to ask you

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.400
to clarify the false accusation
made against Lu Yizhen.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.960
Inspector Guan,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.720
do you know what you're talking about?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.550
The case leak

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.890
has nothing to do with
our Shanghai Police Station.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.260
Whichever officer here

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.340
slandered my officer

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.030
had better come forward and apologize.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.640
However, this has nothing to do with you.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.440
I just hope you will
set an example, Inspector Zhu.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.640
Guan Cen,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.400
have you forgotten your place?

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.790
How dare you be so insolent to me?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.240
I just want justice.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.350
Justice?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.030
What evidence do you have

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.530
to prove it wasn't Lu Yizhen who did it?

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.510
And yet you barge into my station

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.720
demanding justice?

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.920
What is this about?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.520
Director Huo.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.930
Director Huo.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.430
I already know
who leaked the case details.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.700
Let me see you out.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.650
[To Reporter Wu]

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.530
At first, I was just suspicious.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.640
I only realized

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.000
that Wu Xiaoxiao must have known

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.830
more people in the police force
than just Lu Yizhen.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.580
She must have had other informants.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.090
But at that time, I didn't suspect
Zhong Guofeng.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.070
Because back then, Zhong Guofeng

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.270
wasn't involved in the investigation.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.440
He shouldn't have known the case details.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.200
Until...

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.610
Just think of it as doing me a favor.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.000
You want my help?

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.580
When it comes to forensic verification,
you're the one to ask.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.470
Since you're so interested,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.250
why not come see for yourself?

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.310
Where?

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.240
My colleague is celebrating their birthday
in a few days.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.640
I've been invited to dinner.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.770
You should come too.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.720
Sure.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.960
But it's a gathering
of your Forensic Institute.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.790
Would it be inappropriate for me
to attend?

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.590
Of course not.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.270
With our relationship,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.000
who would dare say anything?

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.400
Besides the police officers in my station,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.000
the only others
who know the case details so clearly

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.750
are from the Forensic Institute.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.020
So I asked Dr. Ding to help,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.200
met with their people,
and collected evidence personally.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.330
Everyone here today

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.890
helped you solve cases.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.330
Have you thought about how to thank them?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.320
Ding Eryi.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.950
What is Zhong Guofeng doing

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.960
at your Forensic Institute's gathering?

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.640
Him?

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.830
He and Hua have been best friends
since childhood.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.430
So, how could he have missed this?

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.090
Today is my buddy's birthday.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.550
Let's all raise our glasses

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.640
and wish him a happy birthday.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.830
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.590
Thank you all.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.550
Let's drink till we drop!

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:31.950
Great.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.240
I've confirmed with Dr. Ding

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.310
that Hua participated in the work
on these rape-murder cases.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.440
That means

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.160
Zhong Guofeng had both
a source of information

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.720
and motivation to spread it.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.830
Hua also admitted

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.000
that he leaked information
to Zhong Guofeng.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.460
He also said Zhong Guofeng

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.350
had borrowed related

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.900
rape-murder case materials
in the name of the patrol room.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.840
But he knew nothing about
Zhong leaking the information.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.030
The Forensic Institute

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.830
has reported Hua's misconduct.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.480
Inspector, it wasn't me. It wasn't.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.440
After all that talk,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.300
do you have any evidence?

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.060
Still refusing to admit it.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.170
This is the letter from Zhong Guofeng
to Wu Xiaoxiao.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.570
You should recognize
your subordinate's handwriting, right?

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.400
If this still isn't enough,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.480
we can have the staff
from the Oriental Hotel

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.140
brought over and questioned.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.100
Inspector,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.240
I did this for you.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.640
Nonsense.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.800
What does this have to do with me?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.000
You've always resented
the Shanghai Police Station,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.460
so I wanted to help you
take them down a notch.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.030
Nonsense.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.000
You know full well

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.130
the dirty deeds you've done!

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.890
Enough!

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.400
I'll contact Dr. Ding

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.970
and report this matter together with her.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.540
Zhong Guofeng.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.350
You will be suspended
pending investigation.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.150
Director Huo.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.720
Now that the truth has come to light,

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.900
I have three requests

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.230
for you to consider.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:18.640
First,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.660
clear Lu Yizhen of all false accusations.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.140
Second,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.880
publicly disclose the truth about the leak
regarding the rape-murder cases.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.440
Third,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.550
return the cases to our police station.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.660
I, Zhu, am a reasonable person.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.290
Today,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.240
on behalf of
the entire Laozha Patrol Room,

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.050
I apologize to you all.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.200
Wait.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.430
Lu Yizhen.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.160
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.350
However...

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.240
we've made

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.970
a breakthrough on these cases.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.550
Director Huo.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.000
It's not appropriate to transfer them now.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Time is of the essence.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.310
Transferring the cases
would waste time and resources.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.510
Since we all want to solve them quickly,

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.920
you will work on them together.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.450
Inspector Zhu will take the lead,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.350
and you, Inspector Guan, will assist.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.280
Any objections?

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.710
No objections.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.700
Thank you, Inspector Zhu.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.880
Looking forward to working together.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.400
Alright!

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.650
Everyone, get back to work.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.190
Take care, Director Huo!

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:09.990
[Laozha Patrol Room]

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.480
Thank you.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.340
This meal is on me.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.960
No need to thank me.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.750
I wanted to investigate the cases anyway.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.680
But this meal...

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.270
you can pay for it.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.240
I had no idea you asked Dr. Ding

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.170
for so much help behind the scenes.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.690
I had no choice.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.220
Right now,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.040
only Dr. Ding can help me.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.320
I've really benefited from your help.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.310
If it weren't for your relationship
with her,

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.440
my name wouldn't have been cleared
so quickly.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.440
Keep that in mind.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.880
I won't forget this great kindness.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.750
Inspector, when you

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.240
and Dr. Ding

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.480
tie the knot,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.680
I'll definitely give you
the most generous red envelope.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.310
Lu Yizhen, what are you talking about?

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.970
Isn't it so?

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.740
She even took you

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.240
to the Forensic Institute's gathering.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.700
Everyone thinks you two
are a perfect match.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.810
What they think is their business.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.030
Ding Eryi and I

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.160
just want to quickly clear up
the false accusation.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.270
But you two can
read each other's thoughts—

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.600
that's real chemistry.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.110
What are you looking at?

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.110
If you say that...

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.130
Dr. Ding's boyfriend will get angry.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.980
She and I have been partners
for so many years.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.240
How could we solve cases
without some chemistry?

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.440
Hurry up and eat. We have a meeting soon.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.130
You're certainly fashionably late.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.190
Let me make this clear first:

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.870
since I'm leading this case,

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.000
everything will be done my way.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.610
Do you two have any problems with that?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.800
No.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.110
No.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.090
The rickshaw puller who frequently visited

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.980
both Taihua Restaurants

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.100
has disappeared

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.720
since the murders occurred.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.580
He is a major suspect in this case.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.070
I've already sent informants out
and tracked him down.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.790
I believe we'll have results soon.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.000
Actually, the rickshaw puller was

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.800
already on our list of suspects.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.880
The main issue was
that we lacked substantial evidence.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.080
And according to the hotel duty roster,

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.270
someone on the inside

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.090
would have easier access to

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.500
the victims' movements.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.550
So I think

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.280
we can split up
and investigate from both angles.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.820
Inspector Guan.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.270
Do I need to repeat

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.550
what I just said?

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.830
We will...

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.540
follow your lead, Inspector Zhu.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.450
Solving the case is the priority.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.240
Good.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.600
Everyone, get ready.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.570
Once we have a lead,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.990
we move out immediately.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.610
According to the informant,
the suspect's hangout

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.540
is still a street away from here.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.960
So what's the point of us waiting here?

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.510
We just need to follow
Inspector Zhu's arrangements.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.040
We're not in charge anyway.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.200
Stop munching.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.830
Inspector Guan,
Inspector Zhu wants to see you.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.350
Okay.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.890
I'm going over there for a moment.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.680
Miss!

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.660
Who are you?

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.920
Don't you remember me?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.750
Last time,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.760
you asked me about Chef Dong.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.160
Didn't you ask me about Chef Dong before?

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.920
What a coincidence—

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.120
I was just chatting with him.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.740
Come on, I'll take you to him.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.200
But...

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.750
It's not far, just over here.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.750
Come on, let's go.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:24.560
Let's go.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.700
It's just around here.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.780
It's just ahead. Almost there.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.270
It's right ahead.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:36.480
Where exactly?

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.310
Just ahead.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.420
Where is he really?

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.250
You're here!

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.640
When you came asking about
Chef Dong last time,

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.030
I already felt something was off.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.270
And then right after you left,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.810
the newspaper published
an article smearing us.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.140
Who else but you officers would know
the details of the case?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.160
I hope you can calm down.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.610
We're still investigating.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.960
We'll give you an answer.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.220
Still investigating?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.130
Not only have you caused us
to lose business,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.640
but we're being cursed at everywhere
we go!

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.400
You owe us an answer today

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.400
about what you're going to do about this!

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.310
Get her!

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.770
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.710
-Put your hands down!
-Don't move!

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.600
What are you doing here?

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.890
Playing knight in shining armor.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.240
These men are suspects in my case.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.370
They're involved in a smuggling case.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.510
Chef Dong.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.880
Come on, come on.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.200
You just came back from Japan,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.400
and now you're causing trouble
in Shanghai?

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.590
Chef Dong?

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.210
You're Chef Dong from Taihua Restaurant?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:00.960
Yes.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.420
Do you know

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.480
that you're involved in
a serial murder case?

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.920
Where have you been these past few days?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.790
A murder case?

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.270
I've been at sea these past few days.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.480
I didn't kill anyone.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.480
On the 3rd and 5th of this month,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.920
where were you? With whom?
What did you do?

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:15.880
The 3rd...

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.070
I can't remember.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.640
They're probably not the people
you're looking for.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.350
Our Intelligence Department
has been watching them.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.790
If they had committed any other crimes,

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.720
we would know.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.160
Lu Yizhen.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.690
Are you alright?

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.250
I'm fine.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.530
What are you doing here?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.830
Sorry to disappoint.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.760
You're too late.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.130
We've already apprehended them.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.210
That one is Chef Dong.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.640
Chef Dong?

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.920
But Du Linfeng says

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.750
this is
their Intelligence Department's case.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.750
A smuggling case.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.970
These people used rickshaw pullers
as a front

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.400
to smuggle silver coins
for Japanese ronin.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.400
Our department has been watching them
for a long time.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.510
We've been monitoring them for months.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.910
If they were involved in anything else,

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.170
we would know about it.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.640
What's going on here?

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.740
Inspector Zhu.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.090
Since when

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.680
did this case fall under
your Intelligence Department?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.540
Inspector Zhu,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.460
this has always been
our department's case.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.110
Didn't he already say so?

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.770
This is their smuggling case.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.840
Just because he says so?

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.750
Do you have any evidence?

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.000
The physical evidence is all here.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.330
And we have all these men as eyewitnesses.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.890
Inspector Zhu,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.660
if you need anything else,

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.690
our department is at your service.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.680
Thank you, Inspector Zhu,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.400
for your concern regarding
our Intelligence Department's case

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.330
and for clearing obstacles for us!

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.540
Inspector Zhu,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.810
your men stationed around here

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.070
can withdraw now.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.060
Take them back!

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.480
-Move!
-Move!

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.960
-Go!
-Move!
