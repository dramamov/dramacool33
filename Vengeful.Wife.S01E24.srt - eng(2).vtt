00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.500
Someone will come over here.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.000
It's fine.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.859
Come on, baby.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.540
No.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.920
If Dong finds out,

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:09.219
he'll kill us.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:10.760
If we both keep quiet,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.120
how would he know?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.760
He focuses on her mom at the hospital,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.260
barely managing the company.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:17.819
Has no time to check on us.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:18.640
Let's do it.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.739
This isn't sustainable for us.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.620
Working for him keeps us shackled.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.079
We're living like pets.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.700
He takes his anger out on us.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.480
Stop talking.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.680
Your words make me furious.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.180
Come on.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.976
There's an investment fund.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.659
If you can get Dong's seal,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
we'll take the money and disappear,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.319
living carefree.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.420
Better than

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.599
being his lapdog forever.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.819
You're saying

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
we just need to get the seal?

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.959
Right.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.900
I know where his seal is.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.319
It's in the safe.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.620
And I know the code.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.640
I'll get it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.700
Perfect.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.640
As long as you get that seal,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.620
I'll give you

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.659
whatever you want.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.159
Really?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.140
Want me to approve East Suburb project?

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.520
Forget about it!

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.580
Kuntai,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.199
if you refuse to sign,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.699
don't you fear angering Mr. Ye?

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.599
What if I anger him?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.300
He can't touch me.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.960
At Jiuyao,

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.520
he holds absolute power,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.180
but

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.580
the East Suburb project

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.699
is completely under my control.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.860
You want a piece of this cake?

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.020
Not a chance.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.020
But

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.419
you're a Jiuyao shareholder.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.199
The East Suburb project

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.219
is crucial to our strategic plan.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.419
Your refusal to sign

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.080
only hurts your interests.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.020
So what?

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.080
I can afford it.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:43.900
I simply

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.379
can't stand

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.659
you hypocrites.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.400
So

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.159
you seem to hold

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.439
a grudge against Mr. Ye?

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.520
Heaven sees what people do.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.360
Don't think you can control everything.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:59.960
One day,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.520
your evil deeds will be exposed.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.039
Let me remind you.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.419
I've rescued An Dong

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.199
and what he's provided

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280
will cause you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.979
problems.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.280
You found Mr. An?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.979
What do you want?

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.280
We can negotiate.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.159
Negotiate?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.979
Negotiate with the police!

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.740
Mr. Kuntai,

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.439
I'm Lin Xia.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.400
Ms. Bai,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.639
have you lost your mind?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.719
Lin Xia was probably killed by you.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.520
What?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.139
Now you're impersonating her?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.060
Mr. Kuntai,

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.020
your right leg

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.000
has severe rheumatism.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.939
When the weather changes,

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.419
the pain is unbearable.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.280
You've researched me well.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.080
What?

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.960
Coming after me now?

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.460
You have this condition,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.240
because 30 years ago,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.860
you saved me from the icy river.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.719
Back then,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.000
your right leg

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.419
were suffering from severe rheumatism.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.459
Then it got cut by ice shards,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.459
resulting in disability.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.980
I never told anyone about this,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.699
not even the former chairman.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.319
How did you find out?

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.500
Mr. Kuntai,

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.040
I really am Lin Xia!

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.220
Impossible!

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.139
You must've captured and tortured her.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:38.879
You all deserve to die!

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.319
I used Bai Cha's appearance.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.920
With this new identity,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.860
I'll take revenge on Ye Dong.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:57.319
Look at

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.180
the video of the procedure.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.459
You...

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:16.360
You're Lin Xia.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.699
You're really Xia.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.920
Yes,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.560
I'm Xia.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:25.920
As long as you're safe.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:27.980
Being alive is enough.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.879
So great!

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.899
With your testimony,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.560
I'll put Ye Dong behind bars.

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:40.379
Right now

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.120
we can't do that.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:45.680
Why?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.120
He and his mother killed my father

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.019
and Lin Na

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.500
and caused Bai Cha's death.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.420
Putting him in jail now

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.220
is letting him off lightly.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.160
Xia,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.560
what's your plan?

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.560
We need

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.459
to unite with other shareholders

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.319
to gain absolute

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.680
decision-making power.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.420
Alright.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:32.600
Mom,

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.259
you've recovered enough.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.360
Let's go home.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.379
The company

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.300
has many matters waiting for me.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.060
You haven't spent a full month with me.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.500
You're not going anywhere.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.240
Otherwise,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.839
I'll disown you as my son.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.160
Fine.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:52.699
I'll obey.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.019
After I'm discharged,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.519
I'll arrange your wedding with Wei.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.920
Cut ties with

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.079
those random women.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.079
Let's

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:08.259
discuss it later.

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:10.560
This matter

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.420
is non-negotiable.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.800
Wei's destiny

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.759
aligns perfectly with yours.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.000
If you two marry,

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.579
our Ye family

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.819
will reach new heights.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.500
Are you still thinking about that woman?

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:28.740
I'm warning you

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:29.899
that tramp

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.120
is bad luck.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.600
She'll bring misfortune to you

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.139
and even me.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.560
Stay away from her.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:37.660
Understood?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.240
Dong,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.819
help me!

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:44.959
What happened?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.660
It's

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.019
Mu Feng.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.660
He used your seal to withdraw funds.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:51.420
I said I'd call you,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.500
but he beat me.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.899
He wanted the money and elope with me.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.660
When I refused,

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.019
he nearly beat me to death.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.779
Dong,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.660
Mu Feng has betrayed you.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.259
Luckily, I was smart enough

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.860
to escape with an excuse.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.680
But

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.759
he threatened my parents' lives.

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.600
If I don't give him the money tonight,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.259
he'll kill them.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:09.899
Dong,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.959
please settle this for me!

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.560
How dare he

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.959
betray me!

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.960
Why did Yufei choose such a remote spot?

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.419
Whatever.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.159
Once I get the money,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.419
I'll have fun with her

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.019
and be out of here.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:48.259
Dong.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.080
Feng,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.059
your plan has been exposed.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.120
Hand over the seal.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.460
Let Dong decide your fate.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.259
Dong.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.019
Get him!

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:57.500
Dong,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.200
I've followed you for years

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.779
risking my life.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:01.639
Never expected

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:03.320
over petty cash today,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.840
you

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.759
want to kill me.

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:14.519
After these years with me,

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:16.580
you should know better

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:18.820
what happens to traitors.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.259
Feng,

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:29.799
stop pretending.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.940
Dong,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.799
please forgive him this time.

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:41.519
Go

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.179
kill him.

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:49.860
Qin Yufei,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.059
Dong said

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.779
if you don't kill her today,

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:53.600
both of you

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:54.779
will die.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.340
(Feng,)

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.519
(I had no choice).

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.720
(Feng,)

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.899
(I don't want to kill you.)

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.019
(That demon forced me!)

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.480
No.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.279
No.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.220
(Clues)
After checking Cheng Nuo's connections

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.919
and comparing fake Lin Xia's body,

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.000
we discovered

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.820
the victim's

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.399
characteristics closely match a woman

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.320
named Ai Li.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.299
Ai Li was Bai Cha's best friend.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.259
Then we went to Ai Li's mother

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.820
and DNA tests confirmed

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.360
the body was indeed Ai Li's.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.700
So I conclude

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.159
Cheng Nuo as a plastic surgeon

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:58.820
used his skills

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.100
to transplant Lin Xia's

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.799
face onto Ai Li's body,

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:02.740
so as to

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820
create a diversion

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:05.220
to cover his crimes.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.360
If your theory holds,

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:08.659
where's Lin Xia's body?

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.159
Here's the key point.

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:12.080
Lin Xia isn't dead.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:13.960
She took Bai Cha's face

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.340
to approach Ye Dong

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.019
for revenge.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.340
So you're saying

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:18.580
the current Bai Cha

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.120
is actually Lin Xia?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:20.860
Correct.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.620
Then where's

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:23.379
the real Bai Cha?

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.019
She died

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.899
after the cliff fall.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.500
Cheng Nuo fabricated evidence

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.120
to make us think she survived.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.299
What's his motive?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.059
I can't figure out.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.100
He should hate Ye Dong,

00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:41.720
yet he helped cover his crimes.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.519
No death penalty in our country.

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:44.960
The maximum

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.860
is life imprisonment.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.360
Cheng Nuo

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.759
loved his family deeply,

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:50.899
so he must hate

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:52.059
Ye Dong deeply.

00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:54.519
A feud to the death.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.279
If that's true,

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.899
Cheng Nuo's actions make sense.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:11:59.860
Master,

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.259
what's our next move?

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:05.200
Arrest Cheng Nuo.
