[Episode 4]

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.060
Mr. Li,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.380
before we play,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.220
I have a new friend to introduce.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.300
This is...

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.580
Miss Liu.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.220
[Mr. Li.]

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.100
Seeing is believing.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.300
So you already knew Miss Liu.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.140
Miss Liu,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.820
since you're Wan'er's friend,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.260
tonight,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.620
the three of us

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.100
shall join Mr. Li for a fine game.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.820
How about it?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.860
A pleasure.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.980
Very well.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.500
Come, please sit.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.500
Miss Liu, please.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.700
Excuse me.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.300
You've had a drink.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.820
Let me get it for you.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.900
Thank you.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.780

My apologies.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.820
Mr. Li, your luck tonight

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.620
is quite remarkable.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020
A gift for you, Miss Liu.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.580
Mr. Li,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.660
these chips of yours

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.380
are in the way.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.300
I'll have them exchanged

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.340
and sent to your home.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.780
Sure.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900
The Chamber matter

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.220
is troublesome.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.500
Vice President Zhou
has always had you cornered

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.580
with perfume.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.780
Besides,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
you now have

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.380
the Blycher Hotel incident.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.660
Hard to say.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.620
Mr. Li,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.180
Blycher Hotel isn't ours.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.980
No real effect.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.260
That depends on your father's choice.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.580
Let us try something new.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.220
Time for one last game.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.660
I'll sit out.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.820
These two ladies will keep you company.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.060
Winner takes all.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.460
The loser

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.500
will escort Mr. Li home.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.020
How about it,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.780
Mr. Li?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.460
Dad.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.420
Very well.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
A refined pastime.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.580
At my age,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.220
I enjoy such elegance.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.180
Good idea.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.220
Let me deal.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.420
Mr. Li.

Miss Liu.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.860
Mr. Li, you first.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.020
My apologies.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.700
Wan'er,

show your hand.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.380
Smaller than mine.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.820
Miss Liu,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.220

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.900
Miss Liu,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.780
your hand is even smaller.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.220
You lost.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.460
Here's to you.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.900
Wine alone is useless.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.380
Mr. Wang, will you honor your word?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.260
A bet is a bet.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.820
A bet is a bet.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.580
I'll finish this to show my respect.

Thousand-Step Scent?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.900
What?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.420
Thousand-Step Scent.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.460
Miss Liu, that perfume you're wearing

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.660
is that Thousand-Step Scent

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.660
everyone says lingers on the skin?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.100
Miss Liu,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.180
where did it come from?

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.420
This formula

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.660
was tucked

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.820
in a book

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.420
I bought overseas.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.100
And I had a friend

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.420
make a bottle

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.620
with this formula.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.180
I like the scent.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.580
If you like it,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.900
I'll find the formula

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.980
and send it tomorrow.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380
Indeed.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.060
Having Rumeng come today

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.580
was a happy accident.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.740
It shows you and the scent

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.580
are destined.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.460
Her company can wait.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.380
A rare scent must be taken today.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.020
Mr. Wang,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.460
you are thoughtful.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.900
Then I shall congratulate you here.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.420
You are the leader
of the perfume industry.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.620
You flatter me.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.420
Miss Liu,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.620
I'll be at home tomorrow,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.780
looking forward to your visit.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.580
Do not forget.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.060
Mr. Li, take care.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.180
I shall leave as well.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.580
Miss Liu, please stay.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.540
You are

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.060
Wan'er's friend,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.180
and that makes you a friend
to the Wang family.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.780
We hope to see you here often.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.180
Of course.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.500
I shall go now.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.740
Take care.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.500
Still here?

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.820
You waited for me.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.500
Aren't you afraid they will see you?

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.620
The scent.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.220
Miss Liu,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.460
your Thousand-Step Scent
and your burn scar...

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.820
Wish to know me, huh?

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.780
Control your curiosity.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.740
Meng,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.980
you must not use perfume.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.220
This scar rose

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.620
from the perfume's sting.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.220
The Lin family

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.780
lives by perfume.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.980
Yet you

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.580
can never craft it again.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.660
Every scar on me

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.780
reminds me of what I've done wrong.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.380
I shall send each Wang

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.660
to heck myself,

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.620
and tear off their false masks.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.340
Hua, check Chen Wenbin.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.380
Did he tell them about you?

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.820
He knows Qingmao too well.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.820
I have to check him out.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.460
Can't let him ruin my plan.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.460
If he serves the Wangs,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.420
he is not innocent.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.860
The auction order and funds

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.220
are set for tomorrow.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.500
Blycher Hotel and Marshal Chen

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.380
will be yours.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.380
Only by provoking Wang Wan'er

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.580
can our plan proceed smoothly.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.820
About

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.180
Liu Rumeng,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.660
have you checked her?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.460
She, a singer's daughter,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.980
was taken overseas by Hua's man

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.580
and has only returned recently.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.180
All records are clear.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.140
As for the perfume formula,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.100
I've seen it.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.100
It was indeed in the book.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.180
How did the Lin family's

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.300
Thousand-Step Scent reach overseas?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.580
And Blycher Hotel's raid...

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.260
These matters

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.620
are not so simple.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.500
By the way,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.700
Blycher Hotel will be
secretly auctioned.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.660
Too many secrets inside.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.100
Arrange it well.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.820
We must win the hotel,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.500
then destroy every trace.

[Lot]

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.180
Our first lot today

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.060
is Blycher Hotel.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.940
It was built by

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.500
a European designer.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.860
Blycher Hotel holds
Wang Penghui's opium-dealing records.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.140
At this secret auction,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.380
whoever's against the Wang family

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.900
will show up.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.580
He must know Qingmao's whereabouts.

Number Seven.
