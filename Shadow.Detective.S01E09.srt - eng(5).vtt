something's wrong with the medicine
I got last time.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.680

even if you manage to leave this room,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
I guarantee you won't be able to
get out of this prison.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.170
The higher-ups won't let you off the hook.

And that Crazy Hound, Tang Jiahao,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.840

you couldn't even find a suspect!

I promise
I'll bring the murderer to justice.

Haven't I given you enough time?

You two inspectors are leading

They're obligated... to help you.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.720
By the way, Inspector Zhu,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.790
let me know if you ever need anything.

Alright. I'll leave you to it.

of the 3rd and 5th of this month,

where was your husband?

Him?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.950

Really?

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.950
He's been coming home
every day this month,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.600
so I remember it clearly.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.600

H-He was also at home last night.

But the staff

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.550
at Taihua Restaurant told me

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.140
that their boss spent last night
doing the accounts

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.200
at the restaurant.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.870
Well, I must've remembered it wrong—

I've been swamped with people lately.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.600
He was at home the night before,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.440
and at the restaurant last night.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.500
Actually, I never spoke to the staff.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.080
And your husband
wasn't at Taihua Restaurant last night.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.630
Instead, he went out with friends
to carouse and screw around.

Seriously, what's the matter with you?

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.910
You've been fishing for information.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.840
What is it that you're trying to do?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.030
Stop covering up for him.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.240
If he really is the murderer,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.130
then you're in serious danger now.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.290
Inspector Guan,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.790
you see, I have many customers here.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.080
You also have a lot of cases to work on.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.600
Just go attend to your business, alright?

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.360
If you do know something,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.400
you should definitely tell me.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960
Or there will be another murder
at Taihua Restaurant.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.450
Pour me a drink.
What are you standing there for?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.290
Don't be so nervous. Slow down.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.390
Why the rush?

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.770
No one else is around.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.870
Didn't you go to West Taihua Restaurant?

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.070
What brings you here?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.760
Get out!

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.800

Sit!

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.390
Where were you last night?

Where else could I have gone?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.440
I was here the entire night.

How dare you lie?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.790
Lie?

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.150
I...

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.750
What am I lying about?

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.630
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.490
You weren't home
on the first few days of this month.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.120
Where on earth did you go?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.810
Where else could I have possibly gone?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.430
Did you kill those two people?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.200
Are you crazy?

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.780
You're the one who's crazy!

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.030
If it weren't for this restaurant,

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.670
you think I'd care
whether you live or die?

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.030
No, I...

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.320
Without me,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.270
you would've been arrested long ago!

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.360
P-Please don't be mad.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.080
I'm just afraid that my family business

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.600
will be ruined by you!

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.670
Don't be mad. Please!

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.320
You bastard.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.790
Going out for drinks every day!

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.030
Calm down. This is all my fault.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.790
How dare you...

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.390
I'm sorry.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.790
How dare you go out to drink every day,
huh?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.270
Do you know where he was off to?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:34.680
Yes.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.940
Here's what you do.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.150
Go to the Police Station
to inform Inspector Guan of this.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.600
Got it.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.440
Okay, I'll arrange it.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.730
Inspector Zhu.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.850
Inspector Guan,
you're not playing by the rules.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.940
You're keeping a lead to yourself.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.390
Are you planning to take all the credit
after solving the case?

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.870
Inspector Zhu,
you're taking it the wrong way.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.960
The information I got
hasn't been verified yet,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.380
so I haven't reported it to you.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.480
Have you forgotten

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.110
who's in charge of this case?

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.480
You must report any leads

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.600
you have to me first.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.880
Of course I haven't forgotten it.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.550
Inspector Zhu, you are

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.110
more than welcome

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.170
to lead us officers

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.460
to verify

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.480
the accuracy of this information.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.750
Okay.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.080
Let's go.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.460
Sen.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.260
Tell Dong to proceed as planned.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.460
Let me know if any problems come up.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.030
Yes.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.670
The inspector only told us to follow her

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.670
and nothing else?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.400
Nothing else.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.560
He only asked us
to keep her within our sights.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.720
What's he up to?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.180
This is all so mysterious.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.750
Yeah.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.720
What do you think is going through
the inspector's mind every day?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.240
How strange.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.540
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.270
I'm asking what's on the inspector's mind.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.700
Wait.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.200
Do you see her? Where is she?

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.600
Wasn't she over there just now?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.140
Where has she gone?

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.500
I'll look for her.
You go back to report this.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.390
Be careful!

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.080
What are you doing?

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.840
Where are you from?

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.240
I was just sleeping with a waitress.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.900
Do you have to point guns at me?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.270
Guan, Zhu,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.670
I know you guys!

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.750
Messing with me, aren't you?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.910
Listen up,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.150
I have connections with big shots.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.080
I'll have you pay for this!

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.020
You...

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.670
How skillful.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.010
You're on your knees again...

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.200
I'm sorry.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.110
Inspector Guan,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.960
you call this a lead?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.940
Inspector Zhu,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360
I already told you

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.590
what I got was unverified information.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.530
Can't I satisfy you at home?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.910
Clean up

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.790
this mess yourself, Inspector Guan.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.550
You can!

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.790
Then why did you...

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.120
She seduced me!

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.030
Mr. Li, I didn't! He took the initiative!

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.390
I-I just work here!

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.680
Save it!

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.120
You said you were seduced every time!

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.100
What an insult to my intelligence.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.280
If I had known this, I wouldn't have...

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.630
This is so embarrassing!

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.200
I'm sorry.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.790
Enough!

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.040
Button up your shirt!

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.220
She was just a restaurant staffer.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.750
How could she afford
such a fine jade bracelet?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.670
Look at this.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.570
Another jade bracelet.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.240
Do you know how much I love my wife?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.960
She's got a strange illness.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.880
Though she's only 30 years old,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.270
she looks like an 80-year-old.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.130
She has lost all her hair.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.200
She used to

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.670
love her hair more than anything.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.430
I just want her to have long hair again,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.680
so she won't be upset anymore.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.510
You think you really love your wife?

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.000
You wouldn't do any of this
if you truly loved her.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.410
You just envy those business owners

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.290
for having the means
to hire companionship.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.830
Why can they always get the women
they like?

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.720
Why do I have to be stuck with

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.880
a sick woman?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.670
My wife loves long black hair like this.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.590
Stop...

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.720
Lu Yizhen!

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.120
Freeze!

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.110
Take him away!

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.640
Let go of me!

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.720
Go.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.720
Sit here for a while.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.660
Inspector.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.800
Get that civilian
to the hospital right away.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.720
Yes.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.110
How did you know

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.570
that girl could be
the killer's next target?

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.170
Actually, I was just taking a chance.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.270
Sir, you're not allowed in.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.530
You're not allowed in!

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.310
So, I guessed

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.830
he gave that jade bracelet away.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.260
Inspector Zhu.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.640
I had an police officer notify them.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.060
Inspector Zhu.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.370
The criminal has been arrested.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.500
You can take him back

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.320
and report to Director Huo.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.920
Just because you caught the murderer

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.000
doesn't mean
you get to do as you please.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.730
How did that civilian get shot?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.740
When I arrived,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.430
the situation was tense.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.520
I had no choice but to fire my gun.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.830
Seems like you're taking

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.230
responsibility for that, Inspector Guan.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.010
Then I'll have to honestly
report what happened

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.290
to Director Huo.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.790
I can bear the consequences myself.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.250
You didn't have to do that.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.680
When I got here,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.750
you didn't respond when I called you.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.950
Do you remember that?

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.950
I was injected with a knock-out drug.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.420
Then I fell onto the ground.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.890
When I was looking at Liu Taifu's back
as he attempted to hurt that girl,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.320
I suddenly recalled...

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.470
Recalled what?

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.380
Nothing at all.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.330
You can't remember anything.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.360
How do you take responsibility
for your actions?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.210
Does it hurt?

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.070
It's nothing.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.290
Just a minor injury.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.760
Lu Yizhen.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.750
From now on, no matter what happens,

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.510
let me know

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.570
if any problems come up.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.640
The accidental shooting on a civilian

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.870
was not Guan Cen's fault at all.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:09.530
It was mine.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.980
This matter has already been handed over
to the British.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.040
I don't get to decide the punishment.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.310
I made that mistake.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.910
I can bear the consequences.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.920
Suspending Guan Cen is equal to

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.550
shutting down the entire police station.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.350
Enough.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.510
Do you know how complicated this is?

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.450
Are you aware of the interests at stake?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.480
Listen,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.510
even if Guan Cen wasn't involved
or didn't shoot a civilian,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.720
he'd still be suspended for other reasons.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.400
This is not up to you,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.640
a tiny officer.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.200
Director Huo...

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.240
Cut it out!

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.030
I think Guan Cen is being too nice to you.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.400
He insisted on transferring you
to the Police Station,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.030
saying...

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.160
that you showed

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.670
great potential and talent,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.960
and that it would be a waste
to leave you in Laozha.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.840
Is this what you're really like,
reckless and impatient?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.230
I'm telling you,

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.920
though Guan Cen appears arrogant,

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.550
proud, and distant,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.160
he's actually very perceptive

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.620
and observant about everything around him!

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.170
Regarding this matter,

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.000
he must have his reasons for thinking

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.860
this is the right way to handle it.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.410
Besides,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.550
this case is closed now.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.640
Just let him take a few days' break.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.270
I'll also give you a couple of days off.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.400
Go get some rest too.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.070
What are you staring at?

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.720
He's just temporarily suspended.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.200
Can't you believe me,

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.330
and that I'll properly deal with this?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.160
Get out!

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.670
How stubborn.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.190
[Shanghai Police Station]

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.690
A big case was finally solved.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.110
Inspector Guan deserves some credit
for his hard work.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.400
Isn't suspension too severe
a punishment for him?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.790
Inspector Guan has never made a mistake
during arrests.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.200
Why would his gun accidentally go off
this time?

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.960
Worse still, a passerby was shot.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.590
Lu Yizhen,

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.590
only you were with the inspector that day.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.920
What exactly happened?

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.350
Say something. I...

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.200
Who would've thought
the gun would misfire?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.070
Besides,
that civilian wasn't severely injured.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.240
He has already written a letter
of forgiveness to Director Huo.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.310
Yizhen was knocked out
by an injection that day.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.840
The inspector only meant to help his team,
including us and her.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.620
Inspector.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.100
-Inspector.
-Inspector.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.080
It's okay.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.320
I was thinking of taking a few days off
anyway.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.590
Just go home.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.360
I'll practice a bit longer.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.900
You should leave now.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.750
You need to go to work
at the police station tomorrow.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.350
I'll practice a little more.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.400
I'm fine.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.240
Off you go.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.330
Guan Cen.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.510
I'll be waiting for your return.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.110
Okay.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.590
You're still in the mood for coffee?

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.070
Why wouldn't I be?

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.680
Do you know Guan Cen has been suspended?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.350
Yes, I do.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.280
Then why are you still here?

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.580
Where else am I supposed to be?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.750
Well,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.810
as his good friend,

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.650
shouldn't you go comfort him?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.550
What am I going to say?

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.550
"Don't be upset"?

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.880
"You did nothing wrong to deserve
such harsh punishment"?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.880
You think he'd like to hear all that?

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.880
You and I both know

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.900
he's not that kind of person.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.300
He never acts on impulse.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.720
So, the truth of this matter

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.450
may not be what we've been told.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.010
Alright. I'm leaving.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.050
Put whatever you drink on my tab.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.420
What kind of person is that?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:10.890
How did it go?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.310
Did you recall more memories?

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.080
Perhaps the course of arresting Liu Taifu

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.600
triggered some of your memories.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.240
But I'm afraid it may be difficult

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.600
for you to recover more.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.880
What exactly happened

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.920
that makes you so eager

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.180
to get back those memories from the past?

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.110
Guan Cen has never looked down on me.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.000
On the contrary,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.600
he recognizes my abilities
in front of others.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.270
But I...

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.250
I let him take responsibility

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.960
for a mistake I made.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.880
You're feeing guilty

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.930
but powerless to make amends.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.420
So, you've decided to jog your memories
about the past

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.580
as a way to compensate Guan Cen.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.890
That incident from years ago
still preys on his mind.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.070
I don't think

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.700
a few fragments of memories can help.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.490
So, I'd like to try my best to recall
as many things as possible.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.310
I hope to connect these fragments

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.280
and turn them into useful leads.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.300
I need to point out one more thing.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.560
The memories you've recovered

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.510
indicate that what's going to happen

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.720
will take a turn for the worse.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.920
You're very worried.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.400
You fear that something bad
may happen to Guan Jingning

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.480
because of you.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.890
I understand how you must feel.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.170
But don't rush anything.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.430
Okay, no rush.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.410
Dr. Gu,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.750
today,

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.370
I felt the power
of teamwork for the first time.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.330
In addition to Guan Cen,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.030
Dong would also

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.160
defend me and stand up for me

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.910
in front of others.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.640
In the past,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.120
I always felt like I was fighting alone.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.090
But now it has changed.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.480
That's good.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.350
You're feeling less adrift.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.110
Perhaps the Police Station can help you

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.240
find the long lost sense of belonging.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.240
Very good.
