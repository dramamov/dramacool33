Xie Haohui

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.760
How's it going, Haohui?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.480
Is there any hope for the teacher?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
It's rare

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.640
to see you stumped by a problem.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.800
Teacher

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.640
It's not that I can't solve it,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.200
it's just

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.800
the blackboard has no space left.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's already

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.200
got nowhere left to write.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.880
You're still just like you were.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.240
That's great.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.280
Keep it up.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.360
Teacher Jiang

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.240
I'm Yu Xingchen.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.560
I know.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.560
By the way,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.720
how's Su Ruo doing?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.760
Darn it.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.120
He doesn't know about this.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.760
I never said she had to come.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.520
Maybe she's just busy with work.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.080
I just saw you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640
and suddenly remembered.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.520
You two were so close in school.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.760
So, Yu Xingchen,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.640
after all these years,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.560
anything ever happen?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.840
Jiang, what are you talking about?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.280
We're talking about Su Ruo.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.520
Su Ruo, she...

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.080
What happened to Su Ruo?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120
Yu Xingchen

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.560
I have a few words

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.800
I'd like to say to you alone.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.240
Yu Xingchen

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.120
You did it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000
Teacher Jiang, what do you mean?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.120
My mind is so clear right now.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.120
I keep remembering the past.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.080
I remember asking you back then,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.240
what do you want to be in the future?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.200
You said,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.040
"I want to be a kind person."

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.720
I just hope

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.240
when everyone hits rock bottom,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.480
I'm not just an indifferent bystander.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960
You remember something

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.840
from so long ago?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.120
The moment I saw you today,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.200
I felt

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.640
your eyes are just like before.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.080
Yu Xingchen

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.440
You haven't changed at all.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.520
Jiang fell asleep.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.920
He's even talking in his sleep.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.360
He said Su Ruo's family is gone.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.680
He asked us to look after her more.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.960
I just thought of something.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.920
Let's discuss it.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.040
I already guessed.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.160
Stop hiding.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.280
Some things

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.320
are better cleared up face to face.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.760
I've met your brother-in-law too.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.440
If you're at the hospital,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.880
let's meet up.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.400
Hello?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.840
What do you really want?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.000
You got the photo, right?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.880
You gave that to Su Ruo, didn't you?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.760
Your fingerprints are all over it.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760
No point denying it.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.600
Yu Xingchen

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.200
Yu Xingchen, long time no see.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.400
Let's get straight to the point.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.280
You were with Su Ruo.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.760
You admit that, right?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.240
Nothing to deny there.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
It's free to love, after all.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.520
Tang Song looked into you.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.680
You weren't at the scene that day.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.480
That's right.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.920
Xie Haohui

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.960
You two are still just like before.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.320
study partnership.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.000
Can I ask you a few questions?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.040
Go ahead.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.960
On the photo,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.880
why are your fingerprints there?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.000
Enough, Xie Haohui.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.400
I know you're smart.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.240
Don't play word games, this isn't a test.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.880
I won't lose to you.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.600
I like being challenged.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.440
At our age,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.280
still think you're the center of the universe.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.240
Can't say it, huh?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.000
On the photo,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560
why are your fingerprints there?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.760
If they used cut-out letters,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.360
there shouldn't be any fingerprints.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160
How do you know they're cut-out letters?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.560
You sent me the photo.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.960
Isn't it obvious at a glance?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.840
Maybe you got some on when mailing it.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.360
You must've worn gloves.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.680
No prints when making it.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.600
How could you leave prints mailing it?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.760
The photo you sent is so close up.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.880
Looks just like a note.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.960
How do you know it's a letter?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.920
You said you mailed it.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.280
So it must be a letter.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.560
Not just a note, right?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.960
You all have such wild imaginations.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.680
Save that for Tang Song.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.320
See if he'll give you a chance.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.200
That's enough, you two.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.920
So what if it's a letter?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.360
Besides, the letter just shows

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.760
good intentions toward Su Ruo.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.040
Don't go home.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.480
Stay somewhere else first.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.080
I don't even know what you're suspecting me of.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.520
I only showed you the first half.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960
The police never

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.440
released the second half of the letter.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.120
How do you know the second half says

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120
"Don't go home,"

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.520
"Stay somewhere else first"?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.560
Unless you were the one who sent it.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.120
Either way, you're involved.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.440
We've known the truth for a long time.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.120
This concerns the case.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.880
I'll report everything I just heard

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.840
exactly as it is.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.760
Su Ruo didn't get into college.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.080
She had no one to rely on.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.720
She could only support herself
with hard work and her skills.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.040
You know Su Ruo hasn't had
an easy life these years, right?

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.680
When I met her again,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.800
I treated her really well.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.440
Before she even said what she wanted,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.440
I'd already bought it and put it
in front of her.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.000
Every day after work, I went to see her.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.120
I tried everything to make her happy
every day.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.600
That's how things went for a while.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.400
Eventually, she was moved by me.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.520
She agreed to be with me.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.080
You already had a fiancée
at that time, right?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.720
My fiancée has been after me
since high school.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.960
She kept clinging to me.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.000
But I didn't like her.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.160
Until half a year ago,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.600
my dad's company had
the capital chain broken.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.560
She said her family could help me.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.880
She had just one condition.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.040
That I marry her.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.520
But the one I love is Su Ruo.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.320
So I kept delaying
and didn't marry her.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.880
Not long ago,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.480
she found out about me and Su Ruo.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.800
She made a huge scene with me.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.600
She insisted Su Ruo come out
and settle things.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.840
I was afraid she'd do
something extreme.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.640
So I...

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.960
So you were worried about Su Ruo

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.360
but afraid your handwriting
would be recognized,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.360
so you used cut-out letters.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.560
After Su Ruo learned
I had a fiancée,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.040
she broke up with me.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.840
She returned everything
I gave her.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.640
She gave it all back,
just as it was.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.920
She kept everything
very clear and precise.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.680
What exactly did your fiancée do?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.520
Is Su Ruo's death
really related to her?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.920
I don't know.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.080
She said she wanted
to teach Su Ruo a lesson.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.640
If it really was her,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.760
then I'm the one
who caused Su Ruo's death.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.480
I don't like doing business.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.800
I don't want to inherit
my dad's business.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.200
But I did inherit it.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.160
I don't like Lou Yuting.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.640
But I accepted her anyway.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.160
I just want to protect
the one I love.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.120
But I...

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.840
We've already summoned

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.600
your fiancée for questioning.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.000
Actually, I have one more favor
to ask you.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.480
So she's Lou Yuting.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.280
Alright.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.880
Leave the rest to us.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.280
You should go back first.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.680
Teacher Jiang passed away
last night.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.520
He went peacefully.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.920
In a way,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.000
it's kind of a blessing.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.960
You came to see me

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.320
not just because of Teacher Jiang,
right?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.360
Is there progress
on Tang Song's side?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760
No matter what,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.400
Tang Song wouldn't tell me
the case details.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400
He wouldn't share them with me.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.880
But I've been thinking
for a few days.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.680
I've figured out a few things.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.320
Shortly before the incident,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.200
Lou Yuting found out
about Ren Nan

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.600
cheating and seeing two people.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.520
Ren Nan sent Su Ruo
that anonymous letter.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.760
Lou Yuting was upset
when she found out.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.120
She told her brother.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.720
Her brother took some people
to block Su Ruo.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.120
They planned to scare her.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.400
Force her to leave Ren Nan.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.000
Did they push her down?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.560
That night, for some reason,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.640
Su Ruo went to the rooftop
of the next building.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.520
Just at that moment,

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.960
Di Ge and his group arrived
at Su Ruo's place.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.120
Open the door.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.640
Jianshe Community is an old complex.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.400
You can see the hallway
of the next building
from the rooftop.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.360
When Su Ruo saw

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.080
her own doorway blocked by people,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.520
her first reaction was to run.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.760
She could've just run
out of the complex.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.400
Why did she stay on the rooftop?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.240
Because she was trapped
and couldn't get down.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.840
Why?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.680
She recognized her uncle
in the hallway.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.640
Su Ruo, in extreme fear,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.640
suddenly ran into her uncle
after fifteen years.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.720
Her uncle was drunk,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.880
which triggered her old trauma.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.240
In a state of panic,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.200
she could only run back
to the rooftop.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.400
And locked the door behind her.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.560
She might've tried to climb
down the railing.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.520
You told me before

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.080
that railing was old
and in disrepair.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.200
That's just my guess.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.200
The police are already investigating

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.960
in the direction of negligent homicide.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.800
They're investigating Lou Yuting
and her brother.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.800
So...

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.760
Is there anything else
I can do?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.240
Actually, the police have long
been investigating

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.640
Lou Yuting and her brother.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.760
The case has made
great progress.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.840
So...

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.760
Whatever you do
won't make much difference.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.160
Tang Song asked me
to tell you this.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.800
Class,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.400
who knows how to solve
this problem?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.640
You can come up and write
the answer.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.320
Don't skip any steps
in your solution.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.920
What's wrong, Xie Haohui?

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.400
Even you can't solve it?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.280
No, teacher.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.280
I have many ways
to solve this problem.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.320
But there's no space left
on the blackboard.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.600
I have nowhere left
to write.
