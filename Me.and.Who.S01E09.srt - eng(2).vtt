I know the whole truth now

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.490
The truth

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.670
What truth do you know

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.360
It's just...

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.520
That

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.390
Bro, you’re the mastermind

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.420
You must think

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.950
I sent thugs to hurt you, right

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.370
I believe

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.440
You’re not that kind of person

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.230
Why do you think that

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.340
Don’t you already know

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.720
I hate you so much

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.560
I might send someone to hurt you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.620
So you won’t bother me here anymore

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.780
(It took effort to fool my parents
that we caught the culprit)

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.920
(Why did Apo bring up
the car accident again)

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.500
(Is he suspicious of something)

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.010
(But soon)

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.420
(This mess will be over)

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.720
(Just wait and see)

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.320
(I’ll make sure he rots in jail)

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.190
(He hurt my brother, after all)

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.330
(I’ll never let him go)

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.200
I know

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.110
Actually

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.590
Deep down inside

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.350
You’ve always cared about me

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.150
Right

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.000
What are you saying, I’m gonna puke

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.300
If you really hated me

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.430
Why would you help me investigate

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.440
Right

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.950
Bro, why did you hide this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.630
Honestly

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.970
I think your life is pretty happy

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.610
Everything goes smoothly for you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.860
You’re about to get married

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.450
I don’t want you stressed
by this mess

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.900
And someone like you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.950
Would never believe me

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380
Bro, I’m sorry

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.310
I really suck

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.200
Hey

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.970
What are you doing

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.920
Punishing myself, bro

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.050
All this time I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.370
Always spoke rudely to you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.440
Honestly, if it were me

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.110
I wouldn’t forgive myself either

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.370
Hey, that’s enough

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.570
Punishing yourself for what

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.050
That’s ridiculous

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.010
Thank you

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.310
Shin Ge

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.950
But there’s one more thing
I’m suspicious of

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.000
Why

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.190
The day something strange
was sent to our house

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.190
Ya Ge’s detective

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.010
Saw you go to the police station

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.610
To the evidence room

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280
Then the evidence disappeared

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.840
I just wanted to check the evidence

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.840
And then

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.970
I heard

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.670
Suddenly the evidence was gone,
right

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.170
But one thing’s for sure

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.100
The driver who hit you

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.700
Is still at large

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.890
Sorry

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.410
Hello

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.250
Hi there

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.660
How can I help you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.100
Do you have this car here

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.830
Oh, yes we do

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.630
If you’re interested in this car

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.950
You’ve come to the right place

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.170
I got this car just a few months ago

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.680
Want to take a look

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.980
Please, come inside

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.670
This is the one

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.490
It’s the only one left
in all of Bangkok

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.930
Bro, where did this car come from

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.770
Oh

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.710
He said it was just in a crash

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.200
So it got repainted

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.720
But he didn’t like it

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.350
So he decided to sell it

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.170
You can check it out

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.720
Francois

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.810
I found the suspicious vehicle

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.600

=Who am I with=

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.470
Hi, Ya Ge

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.740
Oh

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.900
Yi, what’s up

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.410
I brought some snacks

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.930
You didn’t just

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.750
Bring my favorite bagel
since you passed by, right

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.050
What if… it’s not just that

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.820
Come on, Ya Ge

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.660
I’m just kidding, Ya Ge

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.630
Actually… I heard the Siao Tawan Group

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.850
Is interested in the Penguin Home Foundation

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.460
I think I can convince them to sell

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.310
Thank you, Yi

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.190
I’ll contact you later

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.440
Okay

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.120
Oh, Apo

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.360
Here to see Ya Ge

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.780
Mm...

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.670
Yes

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.410
So Yi, you…

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.410
Oh

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.040
I just came by to talk
with Ya Ge

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.350
We’re done talking,
I was about to leave

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.320
I’ll take my leave then

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.790
Oh

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.140
See you another day

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.710
Let’s grab a meal next time

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.480
Bye

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.710
What did you bring?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.320
It's...

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.160
I brought this especially for Ya Ge.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.860
If you're full, that's fine.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.510
You can save it for later.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.180
Who said I'm full?

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.590
I'm actually hungry.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.670
Come on.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.800
Wow.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.540
Whoa.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.600
It looks delicious.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.100
Go ahead.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.140
Mmm.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.750
Mmm...

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.980
It's really tasty.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.770
Is this the work of a master chef?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.490
Just now,

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.410
I talked to Yi about the Penguin Home.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.400
He said he can help convince them to sell.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.060
That's great.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.670
Thorn, are you okay?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.750
I'm fine.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.970
Don't forget to find new homes for the kids.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.200
Don't worry.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.490
I won't forget.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.290
And also,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.900
Don't forget to hug me like this again.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.550
Or even go further than a hug.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.270
Ya Ge.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.780
This may be an orphanage,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.460
but some of the kids

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.190
aren't orphans.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480
What do you mean?

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.150
Some of the kids here

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.350
live in the nearby community.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.380
But they can't afford school.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.090
So they...

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.090
come here to study.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.710
If we move away,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.580
these kids

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.340
won't be able to keep studying.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.290
And the kids

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.210
will be separated.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.870
They'll definitely miss each other.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.570
Anyway, thank you so much, Apo.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.080
I'll go check on the kids.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.000
Okay.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.790
It's a pleasure to work with you.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.780
Let's set up another time soon.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.290
Thank you very much.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.420
I'll take my leave now.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.260
Alright.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.610
Aren't you going to play with them?

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:38.570
Thorn.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.870
Ms. Michelle agreed to sell us the land.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.600
Even the signing date is set.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.810
Really?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.800
Are you okay?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.640
Ya Ge.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.900
Mmm.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.470
If...

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.130
Can we stay here a bit longer?

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.470
Of course.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.080
Why wouldn't we?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.830
Hello, everyone.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.210
My name is Apo.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.800
And this...

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.160
This is Mom Rachawong Suriya.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.820
Suriya Dechakorn.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:30.970
Uh...

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.410
Mmm...

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.580
Just call me Ya Ge.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.170
So, what should we play today?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.250
Bad guy, go away!

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.490
Bad guy, go away!

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.060
Bad guy, go away!

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.680
Bad guy, go away!

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.040
Bad guy, go away!

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.980
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.840
If you negotiate nicely,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.100
I can give each of you a gift.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.390
I want a TV as big as a house!

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.510
Okay, you want to watch TV?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.900
No problem.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.190
I'll take care of it.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.500
Yay!

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.660
Oh!

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.270
Who?

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.910
Who poked me? Ha!

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.250
Joking, huh? Joking, huh?

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.380
Ouch!

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.370
I give up! I give up!

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.290
Yay!

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.860
Yay!

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.840
Today was so much fun.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.690
Thank you.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.720
Thank you.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.410
Willing to...

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.610
agree to stay.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.470
Thorn, you asked me to stay

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.400
because you want me to change my mind, right?

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.220
Those kids

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.280
have already lost their real families.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.210
I just don't want them...

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.160
to leave

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.980
the family they love again.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.910
Because I know how painful that is.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.510
Is this for me?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.950
Mmm...

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.160
What did you draw?

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.730
I drew us.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.670
This is Penguin John.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.960
This is Penguin Ya Ge.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.770
This is Penguin Po Ge.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.590
This is our home.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.450
Mmm.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.150
This is a rare group admission.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.340
Let me tell you,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.240
it's just like John's.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.930
I wrote the name right on it, see?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.960
Mmm.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.350
Is this for me?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.400
Yes.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.570
Thank you.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.250
You must be exhausted.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.300
(Tomorrow, sign contract with orphanage)

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.140
Suriya.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.010
This project

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.860
will show the board

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.270
and prove

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.180
to all our partners

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
that you are fit

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.390
to become

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.000
the new leader of Siao Tawan Group.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.420
I hope

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.560
you won't let me down.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.730
I'll do my best.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.760
I heard this project

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.980
was personally handled

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.190
by Young Master Suriya for the land purchase?

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.830
Does this mean

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.120
the chairman is ready to pass the position

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.130
to Young Master Suriya?

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.480
Yes.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.540
If he won't hand it over,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.480
I'd better be careful.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.550
Someone might try to push me out.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.870
That's true.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.010
This orphanage

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.200
has been here since my great-grandfather's time.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.490
Now it's old and falling apart.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.490
I don't have the means

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.420
to repair it myself.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.810
(Just as my great-grandfather said)

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.740
(wait for the land to appreciate)

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.760
(we just need to stay out of reach)

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.490
(big money will come to us)

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.080
Let's just sign directly.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.160
Sigh.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.900
(Buyer)

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.460
Meeting you, Mr. Suriya,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.880
is a huge blessing for these children.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.700
(Ice Penguin)

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.810
Hello, honored guests.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.390
Thank you all

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.390
for attending today's press conference.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.560
I am Mom Rajawong Suriya.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.210
Suriya Dechakorn.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.820
I'm the head of the Cosmos Project.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.980
I hereby announce...

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.710
Siao Tawan Group

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.060
has decided not to purchase this land.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.370
Ha.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.090
May I ask the reason?

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.450
Or did Siao Tawan Group

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.240
find a better plot?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.790
Did the deal fall through?

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.540
- What happened?
- What's going on?

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.370
Because this land is the orphanage's home.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.870
If Siao Tawan Group buys this land,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.550
we'd be taking away the orphans' home.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.550
And the kids from the community who come here

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.170
would also lose everything.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.860
Young Master Suriya, what's going on?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.650
We will change our plan.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.460
We'll shift to supporting and developing

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.970
the orphanage project here.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.840
And establish a foundation

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.840
to fund the orphanage

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.610
and disadvantaged children

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.680
across the country.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.140
This isn't what we agreed on.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.690
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.100
That's all I have to say.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.810
Thank you.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.970
Is that land really becoming a welfare facility?

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.920
- What's going on?
- Really?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.110
Please answer.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.130
Hmm.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.350
But why would Siao Tawan Group

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.600
suddenly change its mind?

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.450
Hmm.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.230
I think the deal is definitely off.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.650
It's the foundation

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.100
that changed its mind and won't sell, right?

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.550
This young master is clever.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.570
He turned a big project

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.580
into corporate social responsibility.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.600
This way,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.040
he goes straight to the headlines.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.560
Siao Tawan Group's image has improved,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.750
but from an investor's perspective,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.400
I don't think they'll be pleased.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.500
Exactly.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.360
I think so too.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.720
Where did my card go?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.120
Did it go to the gas station downstairs?

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.660
Ya

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.420
What did you do?

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.380
Sorry, Father.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.620
But you don't need to worry, Father.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.150
I promise

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.050
I'll find a new plot of land.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.340
It's not just losing a piece of land.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.510
It's also losing our partner's trust.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.140
Do you understand?

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.610
What about those children?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.960
Those kids have already lost their real families.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.210
I don't want them to lose the family they rely on again.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.100
You've really changed a lot.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:46.960
Who made you think this way?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.880
Is it your fiancé?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.610
Back then,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.790
I had you get engaged to Apo

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.850
because I thought

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.670
Apo was decisive and resolute.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.210
He could support your career.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.340
But now,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.890
I think Apo has changed.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.090
Changed so much that I'm unsure

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.890
if you two should still get married.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.850
Father.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.920
I don't see what this

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.060
has to do with my marriage to Apo.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.900
Of course it's related.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.110
You've never wanted to marry Apo.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.020
You don't like Apo.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.420
Then suddenly one day,

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.550
you agreed to marry Apo.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.110
Just because

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.190
you wanted me to hand over the business.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.290
Yes.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.770
I did think that way before.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.360
But not anymore, Father.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.660
I want to marry him

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.510
because I love him.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.300
I'm truly disappointed in you.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.260
Suriya

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.530
Ya Ge, I'm sorry.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.340
Thorn...

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.150
It's all my fault.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.240
I caused...

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.590
you to argue with your father.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.440
It's not your fault.

I know you're upset with Ya about the land.

Can't you see?

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.250
Since Suriya got together with Apo,

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.410
he's changed so much.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.190
I could never

happily watch our son marry that kid.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.820
What does this have to do with Apo?

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.220
I thought

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.940
Apo would make Suriya more decisive.

Suriya

Okay, Madam.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.220
Start with the chicken wings.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.740
Ya likes the upper wings.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.270
Add potatoes.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.610
They're hard to cook.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.340
Then add carrots.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.200
Season it next.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.470
Finally, add

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.220
onion and tomato.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.080
It makes the soup sweet.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.340
Mmm... smells delicious.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.270
Careful, don't drool in the pot.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:50.980
From now on...

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.020
Um...

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.660
Madam, are you alright?

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.150
- Madam?
- Madam?

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.340
Um...

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.580
Here.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.790
Should we see a doctor, Madam?

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.120
Don't make a fuss.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.330
Just stressed lately, I'll be fine soon.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.580
Get me some balm.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.190
Balm?

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.900
Hurry.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.740
Yes, yes.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.170
Uh, Auntie...

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.950
Do you have any tea?

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.410
Like chamomile or something?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.520
Wait a moment.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.650
Much better.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.430
Feeling better, right?

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.010
When Ya Ge is stressed,

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.360
I help him like this too.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.940
It's because...

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.240
I came to see you today

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.640
to talk about the wedding.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.930
About Uncle...

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.000
He won't attend the wedding, right?

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.950
It's just...

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.730
Ya Ge and I...

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.050
feel the same way.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.660
While Uncle is still angry,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.100
we don't want to hold the wedding yet.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:31.770
If...

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.770
Can I wait and talk to him?

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.600
I don't know when he'll be home.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:43.940
Or if he'll come home at all.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:48.340
Honestly,

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.020
he rarely talks to me.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.490
A loveless marriage

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:58.390
is just like this.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.120
Like strangers.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.270
So I don't want Ya

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.010
to have a marriage like mine.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.010
A lifetime with a stranger.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.640
Madam...

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.000
I truly love Ya Ge.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.200
I swear.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.500
I'll never let him feel lonely.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.840
I'll do my best to protect our marriage.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.730
I'll help talk to him about the wedding.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.760
Really?

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.440
I've seen it.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.000
Ya is much happier

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.360
than before.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.940
Apo, please take care of Ya for me.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:00.600
Of course, Madam.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.820
Mm.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.350
Don't call me Madam anymore.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.380
Mm.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.130
Okay.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.760
Mom.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.110
Say it louder.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.170
Okay, Mom.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.050
Mm.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:34.910
Honey,

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.390
Apo came by a few days ago to see you.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.890
He truly hopes you'll attend the wedding.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.170
I told you,

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.170
it's not convenient for me.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.820
I don't know

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.570
in your mind,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.490
who is right for our child.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.650
Don't you want to see our child happy?

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.110
And you?

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.450
You brought the master here.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.170
You brought Yi

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.170
back into our child's life.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.790
Is that

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.080
what you call wanting our child happy?

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.560
I was wrong back then.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.610
But everything I did

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.120
was for our child's happiness.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.550
I don't want our child's marriage

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.770
to end up like ours.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.980
But now,

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.200
our child has found someone he loves.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.430
And that person truly loves Ya.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.490
I think...

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.200
we shouldn't stand in the way of their happiness.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.570
Alright.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.930
Darn it.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.500
Ya Ge!

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.380
Ya Ge!

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.870
What's wrong? What happened?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.300
Father agreed to come to our wedding!

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:16.070
Father?

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.260
Yes!

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.100
Oh wow!

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.930
Calm down.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.430
My Thorn is the best!

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.820
Speaking of which, you're getting nervous too.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.390
I wonder if I'll freeze up on the wedding day.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:37.880
Just imagine, Ya Ge.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.070
If on the wedding day

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.260
I walk through the ceremony arch

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.920
and then trip and fall—

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.480
That would be hilarious.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.120
Should we rehearse it a bit?

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.820
Uh...

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.950
Over here, this way.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.040
You start from here.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.400
This is the starting point.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.840
Okay?

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.350
I...

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.810
Apo Yue

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.830
am willing

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.460
to love, respect, and care for

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:13.910
Mr. Suriya

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.070
Suriya Dechakorn

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.730
every day of my life

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.300
in good times

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.870
or in hardship,

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.140
in wealth

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.230
or in poverty,

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.300
in sickness

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.670
or in health.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.370
I...

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.130
will care for him every day of my life

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.090
until the end of our lives.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.720
I, Suriya

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.400
Suriya Dechakorn,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.740
am willing to love and respect

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.740
and care for Phopthorn

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.460
every day of my life.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.110
I swear

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.650
I will be loyal to you

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.270
in hardship

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.720
or in good times,

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.650
in wealth

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.440
or in poverty,

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.520
in sickness

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.560
or in health.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:06.560
I swear

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.830
to love

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.210
and respect you

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.910
until the end of our lives.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:09.860
Who?

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.100
It's me, Tailah.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.200
Come in.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.340
How are you?

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.450
Are you ready for today?

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.220
Yeah.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:40.310
But—

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.800
Don't try to talk me into running away today.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:47.330
Okay.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.040
Since that day,

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.310
a lot has changed.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:08.400
What's going on?

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.800
Actually,

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:25.730
I've liked you for a long time.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.140
You probably knew that, right?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.840
Hey—

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:42.640
But that was before.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.520
Sorry for telling you only on your wedding day.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.650
But what I really want to say is,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.100
since you woke up,

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.760
it's not just you who's changed.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:55.370
My feelings have changed too.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.980
How I feel about the Apo after you woke up

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.400
is totally different from before.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.340
So...

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.820
Why did you like the old Apo?

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:18.280
I don't know.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.280
Really.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.960
The Apo now is so much better than before.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.650
I don't understand my own feelings either.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.590
But I understand you.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:36.630
Actually, I also

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:39.330
want to thank you for something.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:41.840
For what?

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:45.750
I'm really grateful to you

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.790
for letting me be the good version of Tailah's friend.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:54.610
Yeah.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.960
What's wrong?

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:07.310
Hey, Po.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.620
Can I ask you something?

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.090
You know Suriya Dechakorn's secret, right?

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:19.590
Huh?

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.360
What do you mean?

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.780
Oh, that.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.570
Yeah, I know.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.580
I really can't believe it.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.690
That something like this exists in the world.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.820
Wait, Tai.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.000
Did Chan give it to you?

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:45.540
What?

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.560
Don't you think

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.660
they're lying and mind-reading us?

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.660
Hmm...

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.730
Honestly, I thought so at first too.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.450
But then we learned to respect each other's space.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.030
We slowly adjusted.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.030
Now he and I get along well.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:05.590
Really?

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.040
I feel like

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.080
he's lying and reading my mind

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.020
and just trying to make me happy.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.460
Tai.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.040
Yeah?

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.330
Listen to me.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.080
He can read hundreds of people's minds,

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.310
but that doesn't mean he cares about everyone.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.360
He chooses who he cares about.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.200
Hmph.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.110
He cares about you so much—

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.180
doesn't that mean he chose you?

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.620
Let me say it again.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.470
You've really changed a lot.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.600
You can go now. Hurry and get ready or you'll be late!

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.090
Go on out.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.850
See you in a bit.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.800
Thank you, Mom.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.130
Hello.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:16.710
Hello.

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:17.340
Hello.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.880
Hello, Madam.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.200
Hello, groom.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:23.580
Let's take a photo together.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.170
Sure, sure!

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.230
Let's take the first one.

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:26.390
Come on, come on.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.500
Okay, okay.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.880
No need to wait for others, come on.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.230
One, two, three.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:33.870
Alright.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:34.590
Thank you.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.990
You look even more impressive dressed like this, Ya.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:39.280
You're too kind.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.380
Where did the co-in-law go?

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.240
- Hmm...
- Is he in the hall?

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.720
Yeah, is he in the hall?

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.230
Oh.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.050
He'll be here soon.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.290
He'll be here soon.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.290
Thank you.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.750
I won't read your mind anymore, Tailah.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:18.920
Please forgive me.

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.960
I'm not afraid of you reading my mind anymore.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.660
Young Master Chanjak

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.480
Let's have a proper talk.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.520
Really?

Hello, I'm Tailah

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:19.030
Nice to meet you

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:24.160
But if I meet you

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.360
I can still read minds

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.030
Nice to meet you

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.680
Is it Ya Ge?

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.350
Hello, uncle

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.210
I'm still upset about the land issue

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.240
But since today is

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:16.780
my son's wedding with the one he loves

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:19.340
the wedding

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.260
Of course I must come to congratulate

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.660
the two of them

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.260
This necklace

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.770
I gave it to my wife at our wedding

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:37.090
Now

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.990
It's time for you to wear it

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:43.960
Thank you

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.780
Uh, wait...

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.160
I'll put it on myself

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.260
Mm

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.050
Thank you so much, Father

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.140
(I've only seen this in dramas before)

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.550
(The bride walking into the wedding scene)

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.220
(This feeling)

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.050
(So this is how it feels)

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.040
(Thank heaven)

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.040
(for giving me a new life)

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.040
(for letting me meet)

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.180
(the one I'll spend my life with)

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.940
(Though I'm not the real Apo)

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.520
(from now on)

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.200
(I swear)

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.760
(I'll do my best to be Apo)

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.010
(and always stay by Ya Ge's side)

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.400
Who are you?

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:15.910
You're not Apo

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:17.030
Ha

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.020
What?

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:21.370
Necklace

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.840
Who gave you this necklace?

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.940
It was me

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.240
I've wanted to know for a long time

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.560
Why have you changed?

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.360
So...

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.430
You're not Apo

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.350
You're someone unknown

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:38.000
who took over Apo's body

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.360
What nonsense are you saying?

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.370
Mother-in-law, listen to what he's saying

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:43.360
This is my son Apo

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.340
What's your problem?

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.530
Speak properly

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.720
Don't accuse each other like this

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:51.210
Oh

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:54.920
Let's leave here

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.030
Fake things

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:58.870
will be exposed

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.360
one day

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.210
You knew from the start

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:10.120
he wasn't...

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.250
All I know

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.740
is this person

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.540
is the one I love

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:17.990
You've been fooled by that impostor again

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:18.840
Is that so?

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.340
If you still want to inherit Siao Tawan Group

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.090
You must be more decisive

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.790
He makes me a better person

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.050
My life is better with him than without

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:38.730
Suriya

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:41.770
If you choose that child

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.570
and walk out of here

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.040
you will no longer be
Suriya Dechakorn

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:02.960
(Ya Ge)

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.630
(Don't do this)

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.970
(Talk to your father properly)

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:21.880
Then from now on

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.170
I am no longer
Suriya Dechakorn

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.360
Son...

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.350
Ya, my son

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:02.830
Mom, mom, mom

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.920
Mom

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:05.560
What happened?

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:06.880
No idea

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:18.860
=With whom am I=

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.180
After the wedding

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.170
Where should we go for our honeymoon?

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.930
I want to go

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:33.770
to a villa by the sea

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:38.320
I want to hear the waves with Ya Ge

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.720
What about you, Ya Ge?

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.280
Where do you want to go?

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:49.060
Anywhere is fine

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:52.910
As long as I can be with you all day

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.580
All day?

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.000
Not just all day

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.250
It should be a lifetime

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.010
I love you, Thorn

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.260
I love you too, Ya Ge

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.890
Then...

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.200
