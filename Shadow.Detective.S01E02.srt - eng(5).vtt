00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.090
Why did you kill Fan Kunyi?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.280
I didn't kill anyone.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.720
When he died,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.079
you were the only other person
in the room.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.930
There are plenty of witnesses to that—
don't even try to deny it.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.960
That's not direct evidence, is it?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.910
Then what evidence do you have

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.190
that you didn't do it?

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.430
This time, you won't be lucky enough

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.750
to get away again.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.960
What do you mean by that?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.190
Dong,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.650
I'm not here to interrogate you.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.720
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.190
I didn't kill anyone.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.420
Fan Kunyi also had a heart condition.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.650
His medication bottle
was found at the scene.

The forensic officer
is collecting evidence.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.100
As for the real cause of death,
let's wait for the autopsy report.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.490
Why do I always end up
in situations like this?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.220
Here, have some water.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.080
Save your fake kindness!

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.430
When I'm at my most vulnerable
and helpless,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.120
all it takes is a little act of kindness,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.440
and you get everything you want from me,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.360
right?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.750
That's why you wait until she is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.610
at her most vulnerable and desperate,
and then take advantage of her.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.730
By throwing her a little kindness,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.470
she'll offer herself up completely.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.160
It seems there's a misunderstanding
between us as well.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.820
Oh, really?

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.450
and heard with my own ears—

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.960
is that not real enough?

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.530

I don't know what happened
between you two,

walk free.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.650

Quite calm.

She only became slightly agitated
when Lu Yizhen

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.370
was brought up.

Yes, indeed.

They were always

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.910

when I returned to campus
to pick something up,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.310
I happened to pass
by Professor Huang's office

I've got new findings.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.570
Fan Kunyi's death wasn't
due to a simple heart attack—

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.950
there was another cause.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.720
Correct.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.120
We found a significant amount

of sodium azide in Fan Kunyi's body.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.560
It is

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560
a chemical that has only
become available recently,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.220
often used as a preservative.

It's colorless and odorless
at room temperature,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.950
just a few grams

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.750

What's more,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.760
the presentation very closely resembles
that of a fatal heart attack.

Given Fan Kunyi's pre-existing
heart condition,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.860
lacing his medication

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.120

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.720
Just how much of your family's savings
did your husband spend

the woman he was seeing

That's right.

on that whore,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.070
without a single thought for me!

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm so full of regret—

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.780
I should have

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.750
tormented him more before letting him die!

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.450
So you killed Xiang Man too?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Xiang Man?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.480
Why would I kill her?

The one who deserved to die is Lu Yizhen!

If I'd known

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.910
she was involved with that scum,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.850
I would have made sure
she suffered the same fate!

You've got the wrong person.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.080
What did you say?

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.080
So Xiang Man's killer

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.330
is someone else entirely?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.040

From now on, let's go our separate ways
and leave each other alone.

confirmed that Fan Kunyi and Xiang Man

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.070
died of sodium azide poisoning.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.030
Sodium azide

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.480
is a highly toxic chemical—

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.810
its poisoning symptoms
closely resemble those of a heart attack.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.270
Huang Tinghui
discovered Fan Kunyi's affairs,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.480
stole sodium azide

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.670
from the university lab,

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.870
and laced his heart medication with it.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.390
So you're saying...

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.200
when I met Fan Kunyi,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.460
he had already taken the poisoned pills?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.030
Correct.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.240
Then what did you mean by

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.200
"only caught one of the culprits"?

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.460
Are you saying she didn't kill Xiang Man?

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.930
We're not sure.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.720
Huang Tinghui hasn't confessed
to Xiang Man's murder.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.030
Moreover, according to the lab records,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.380
the amount of sodium azide missing

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.240
is consistent with a lethal dose
for one adult male.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.960
As a professor
of the chemistry department,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.960
she is precise in her measurements—

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.390
which lends

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.000
some credence

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.390
to her claim
that she didn't kill Xiang Man.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.510
But since sodium azide
is a highly toxic substance,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.120
access to it should be
heavily restricted, right?

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.050
Ordinary people

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.800
shouldn't be able to get it.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.030
That's exactly the issue we're facing now.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.910
Why are you telling me all this?

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.110

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.240

You were disoriented

the police questioned you repeatedly,

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.680

lost the memory of that period.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.400
The doctors concluded that your mind

had sealed off those memories

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.970

that keeping those memories away

this sample contains sulfur,
