00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
Why are you here?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.630
Tell me.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.060
What did you tell Du Linfeng about me?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
I didn't say anything.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.470
I have a good sense of boundaries.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.750
The things you told me not to mention—

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.150
I didn't say any of them.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.040

to investigate the old case with him?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.500
Because I want to sit here.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.840
The inspector has his own office.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.570
It's inside.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.830
You should go sit in there.

The feng shui there is bad.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.290
And I don't want
to pack things for Guan Cen.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.350
Let Dong sit there.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.400
Did you ask for his opinion?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.870
Dong.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.250
Will you let me sit here?

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.160
Of course.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.510
Of course I will.

I don't have that many rules.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.040
Call him whatever you like.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.000
Welcome back, Inspector Guan.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.690
This is the Police Station.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.520
That's me.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.090
Okay.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.970
An unidentified female body
was found near the market.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.030

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.430

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.010
Yes.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.159
Director Du just arrived

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.750
and is facing such a big case.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.940
We haven't worked with him before.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.800
Will this work?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.770
Who knows?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.810
Someone knows me.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.580
If you can get along with him,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.000
you won't need
an adjustment period with me.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.530
Let's go.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.070
Don't you think the 2 inspectors
knew each other long ago?

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.560
They do seem like they're at odds.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560
I think
there have always been rumors like that.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.820
I'll be on Inspector Guan's side anyway.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.950
What's the situation with the deceased?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.310
Our preliminary assessment is

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.650
the deceased was likely stabbed
in the organs by a sharp weapon

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.600
and died from excessive blood loss.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.430
No signs of sexual assault before death.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.390
Time of death?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.730
Probably around midnight last night.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.070
Look at the necklace on her neck.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.000
It's quite valuable,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.660
but the killer didn't take it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.800
This means

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.770
their goal wasn't robbery.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.460
That's the result
of the on-site examination.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.390
We need to go back
for further death investigation.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.920
Let's go.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.290
Okay.
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Ding.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.920
You're the one working hard, Director Du.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.800
The crime occurred at night yesterday.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.909
The chances of eyewitnesses
are probably low.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.080
-Let's first investigate...
-Let's first investigate...

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.170
Let's follow Director Du's lead.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.310
Let's first investigate
the deceased's background.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.720
Yes.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.310
Look into it.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.720
Yes.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.960
Dong, report your findings.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.250
Guo Luyao, 23 years old, unemployed,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.380
lived alone in Tanxian Alley.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.800
The market where she was killed

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800
is only a few hundred meters
from her home.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.200
The market is empty by noon.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.390
And the alley is old,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.920
mostly inhabited by elderly people,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.980
so it's difficult to find witnesses.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.490
It wasn't robbery or sexual assault.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.380
Could it be the killer
had a grudge against Guo Luyao?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.310
Looks like I came at the right time.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.330
I'm sorry, Director Du.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.840
I forgot... you're in this position now.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.789
Dr. Ding, if you can't even remember

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.039
such a small matter,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.630
the credibility
of the Forensic Institute's reports

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.240
drops considerably.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.120
People can sit in positions

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.920
that don't belong to them for no reason,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.980
but reports can't.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.630
Well...

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.020
Director Du is here to help us.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
It was found on the deceased's body.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.570
Laojiumen's chip?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.670
Looks like we have another lead.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.630
Let's split up.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.590
Lu Yizhen, go to Laojiumen with me.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.280
Guan Cen,
you go to the victim's home with Dong.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.430
I... Well...

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.540
You what?

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.870
Evidence waits for no one.
Hurry up and go.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.000
Meeting adjourned!

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.110
Bet!

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.320
Thank you, Mr. Du.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.240
Just...

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.260
this table today?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.180
It's not the busy time yet.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.500
People will come soon.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.510
I heard

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.000
Guo Luyao was here yesterday.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.150
Yes, she had an argument with Mr. Lyu.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:38.910
Mr. Lyu?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.000
Who is Mr. Lyu?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.270
Lyu Zhang, our manager.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.310
He and Guo Luyao are quite close.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.820
But...
I can't really say how close they are.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.930
Why did they argue?

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.040
I was seeing them out at the time.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.320
I think I heard something about...

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.390
bringing in customers and splitting money.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.910
I didn't hear the details clearly.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.550
I think it was just drunk talk.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.480
Just drunk talk.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.070
Then they left.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.630
Inspector.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.960
I don't think

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.390
Liu Xiaodan moved into the villa
less than a month ago.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.270
The maid went back to the countryside
for half a day each week.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.400
Combined with the footprints at the scene,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.460
the suspect must have come prepared.

This is a photo from the scene.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.300
The shoe print is about 25 cm long,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.570
likely men's shoes.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.640
And they aren't straw sandals
or leather shoes,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.840
more like rain boots.

we found other textile fibers,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.480
something like cotton or linen.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.680
These clues are still too vague right now.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.880
We can't deduce much about the suspect.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.270
Both victims

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.750
had a lot of valuable belongings on them
when they died,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.310
but nothing was taken.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.050
And there were no signs of sexual assault.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.310
And they were classmates.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.180
It could be a retaliatory killing
by someone they knew.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.400
We can go check their former school.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.790
We might find new leads there.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.160
Okay.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.560
Alright.

Leave it to me and Lu Yizhen.

Ms. Liang,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.830
do you still
have any impression of Liu Xiaodan?

bad ones though.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.380
Many girls were bullied
by Liu Xiaodan and her group.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.350
But the school wanted to keep things quiet

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.080
and covered up many incidents.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.350
That only emboldened them further.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.270
Ms. Liang,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.720
we've already identified
2 members of the small clique.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.520
Can you help us

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.330
identify the remaining one?

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.040
[Ma Hanqiao]

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.510
According to the school's archives,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.410
Liu Xiaodan, Ma Hanqiao, and Guo Luyao

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.650
were notorious at school back then.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.440
They bullied many students.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.950
So we can't rule out the possibility

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.610
that this is revenge
from someone they bullied.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.160
The top priority now

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.550
is to quickly identify

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.070
which students were bullied

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.400
and to find Ma Hanqiao
as soon as possible.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.350
We don't have much time left.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.440
By the way,
this is the list we got from the school.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440
Distribute them.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.720
Prepare to head out.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.350
Okay.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.310
Everyone we visited said

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.370
they couldn't remember

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.230
what happened back then clearly.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.990
However,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.880
though the names of those who were bullied

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.540
they provided are different,

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.070
one name was mentioned repeatedly.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.210
Everyone without exception mentioned her:

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.750
Tao Fan.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.200
According to them,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.350
they had a class reunion not long ago.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.450
Tao Fan attended it too.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.920
It was the first time
she attended a class reunion

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.850
since graduation all these years.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.920
But even so,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.030
on that day,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
she was still publicly humiliated.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.030
I heard that after graduation,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.480
Tao Fan didn't continue her studies.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.030
She didn't look for a job either.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.510
She's just been helping out
at her family's restaurant.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.640
Her family's restaurant is called...

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.960
Ruyi Restaurant.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.480
If she works in a restaurant,

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.410
that matches my information.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.790
I ran some tests.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.240
The shoe prints
found at Liu Xiaodan's villa

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.430
indeed include oil stains,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.960
specifically cooking oil.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.210
Restaurant?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.370
I'll go to Ruyi Restaurant
and bring Tao Fan back.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:01.750
Okay.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.240
Dong, go with him.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.720
Director Du,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.490
didn't you ask me
to organize the statements?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.200
I...

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.530
Then... Then I'll... I'll go.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.000
I don't have anything else to do anyway.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.530
Let's go together. Come on.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.750
[Wansheng Street
All Are Welcome]

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.850
You and Du Linfeng seem quite in sync.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.600
It's just work.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.750
Just like you and Dr. Ding.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.470
Du Linfeng might not see it that way.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.400
I can't control what others think.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.320
I only need to know what I think.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.970
Thoughts can change.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.510
I've never seen anyone

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.510
who can resist

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.710
Du Linfeng's sugar-coated sweet talk.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.640
I can.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.930
Eyes on the road.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.270
There's something I need to tell you.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.960
What is it?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.280
He knows we're investigating the old case.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.610
How did he know?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.880
It's my fault.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.390
I wasn't careful enough.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.240
What does he know?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.060
He knows everything we've found out.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.000
But here's what I think.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.640
Maybe it's good that we tell him.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.070
Some things are much easier
for the Intelligence Department

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.600
to investigate than for us.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.840
It can also help

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.700
clarify things sooner.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.110
But I never expected him
to come to the police station.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.920
I didn't tell him
about the fire at the abandoned factory.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.790
[Ruyi Steamed Buns Shop]

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.730
Okay, take care.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.400
Steamed buns! Hot steamed buns!

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.400
You two,

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.660
what would you like to eat?

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.750
I'm Guan Cen, an inspector
from the Police Station.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.440
Officer,

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.200
we haven't done anything illegal.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.070
Besides,

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.770
this isn't shady business.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.110
And our prices

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.440
are already very low.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.310
Madam, don't panic.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.000
We're here for Tao Fan.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.360
We want to talk to her.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.260
What about her?

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.430
What did she do?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.790
She's very well-behaved.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.720
She always helps me in the kitchen.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.050
She rarely goes out.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.970
You must have the wrong person.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.680
We want to ask her

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.940
about her classmates.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.270
Is she in the shop now?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.570
Tao Fan!

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.200
Tao Fan!

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.540
Madam,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.870
has Tao Fan been helping at the shop

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.480
since she graduated from high school?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.400
She originally

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.990
planned to go to college.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.130
For some reason,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.700
she gave up after finishing high school.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720
But maybe giving up was for the best.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.100
A family like ours

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.240
doesn't have that much money
for her education.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.880
Besides, she hasn't been in good health.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.920
It's better she stays with us
so we can look after her.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.470
A family like ours doesn't ask for much.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.680
We only want

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.510
to live a simple life and stay healthy.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.350
What kind of work
does she usually do in the shop?

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.280
She does all sorts of odd jobs here.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.240
She was just helping her father
wash dishes in the kitchen.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.100
Her father went to buy groceries.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.030
As for her,

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.120
she's afraid of getting her own shoes wet,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.980
so she always likes
to wear her father's rain boots.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.700
Let's go.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:54.880
Madam.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.130
I might need to take those rain boots.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.750
Wait a moment.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:10.790
Dong.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.260
These shoes were brought back
by Lu Yizhen.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.790
See if we can find any clues.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.920
These shoes belong to Tao Fan.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.310
She's been taken by Guan Cen and Lu Yizhen

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.020
for questioning.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.870
Take a look.
