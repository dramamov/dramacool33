00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.739
Young Master,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.858
the demonic energy invasion
is far worse than before.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.978
You fought on your own.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.539
Your wounds are serious.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.240
You should return
to the sanctuary to heal.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.060
I'm fine.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.818
Zhilou will treat me here.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:10.618
Zhilou again.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.338
She's all you ever think about.

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:13.139
Is that a problem?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.859
Do you expect him to think about you?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.299
Young Master has his own plans.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.859
Plans?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.019
This is what you call plans?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.899
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you blaming me?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.979
I would never blame you.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.460
- Watch your attitude.
- I...

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.840
- It's all your fault.
- It's all your fault.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.580
Young Lord.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.419
Just call me Li Yan.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.658
The salve Xiaoyu made for you

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.859
slowly formed

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.139
a protective layer
over your eyes over the years.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.938
Using Xiaoyu's medical texts,

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.579
I looked over your past condition

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.139
and wrote this prescription.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.098
As long as you keep using it,

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.220
perhaps one day
you'll see the light again.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.818
Thank you, Zhilou.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.058
You know my mother's temper
is unpredictable.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.699
Yet, you still risked your life
to treat her.

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.139
And now you're
trying to restore my sight.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.780
I don't know how to repay you.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.659
You owe me nothing, Young Lord.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.859
(I wonder)

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.020
(when he'll finally see again.)

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.139
All I can say is
he may regain some vision.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.859
But I'm not sure how much.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.819
He...

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.259
may not fully recover.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.900
How much will I be able to see?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.099
Only what's right before you.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.900
It's okay.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.340
If that's the case,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.659
I can see the one standing before me.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.179
Dragon God, it has only been a day.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.019
How are you already this drained?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.818
Where's Feng Zhilou?

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.378
We need her to treat Young Master.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.538
She's treating Young Lord's eyes.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.899
She's very busy.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.419
Bai Lu,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.819
go fetch Feng Zhilou.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:11.620
I'll go.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.939
Don't disturb Feng Zhilou

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.179
while she's treating patients.

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:19.259
You're injured and still have

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.459
the energy to get jealous?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.939
What do you know, kid?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.338
Hey, I'm 900 years old.

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:25.460
What 900-year-old
plays with a bamboo-copter?

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:27.418
It's called experiencing the mortal way.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.539
Have you even tried it?
You stupid bird.

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:30.558
You're the stupid bird.

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:32.019
- You stupid flood dragon.
- You're stupider.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.459
You're worse.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.778
- Stupid!
- Stupid!

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.619
You overgrown snake!

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.099
Childish.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.900
You stupid overgrown snake.

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.099
Your Grace,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.299
our situation is becoming dire.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.218
Yue is growing weaker by the day.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.139
Her blood

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.059
barely sustains Her Lordship now,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.859
let alone you.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.259
Taking blood from Feng Zhilou

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.700
is not possible.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.539
Chu Moshang will
keep a tight watch on her.

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.299
That makes Yue's blood
even more precious.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.940
If that day really comes,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.739
the only one
I can look out for is myself.

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.979
The most important thing now

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.178
is to have the sanctuary
confirm my identity.

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.418
So Yue will willingly cling to life

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.340
until my wedding day.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.978
Your Grace,

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.499
once you begin,

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.580
you'll end up just like Her Lordship.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.539
Do I even have a choice?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.179
The only person

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.979
I can rely on is myself.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.419
Only by becoming the true Dragon Queen

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.059
can I gain real power and status.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.780
(Yingyue Palace)

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.940
(Youyun Pavilion)

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:04.858
Miss Zhilou,

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:07.098
Young Lord and Chu Xiaoyu
have already left.

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.739
May I speak with you?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.260
Go on.

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.139
It was wrong of us
to hide Young Master's true identity.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.659
But he's injured now.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.619
Could you set aside your grievances

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.260
and help treat him?

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.820
How is...

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.619
your wound?

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.580
How do you feel?

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.619
Better.

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:27.900
Then rest early.

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.978
Zhilou. There's something I want to tell you.

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:33.580
What more is there to say?

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:39.380
After I was wounded by the Demons,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.139
I remembered the first time

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.780
I held the Icebound Sword

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.739
and accidentally cut myself.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.979
Back then, my father did not comfort me.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.899
He told me

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.419
that as his eldest son,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.900
guarding the sanctuary

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.739
was a duty I was born with.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.338
If the sanctuary ever falls

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:57.659
and the Demons invade,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.700
I shouldn't hesitate

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.380
to give my life.

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:03.299
And if I want to become Dragon King,

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:06.099
I'll have to follow
the Dragon King's Decree.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.220
Marry the Wujing Saintess.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.059
Back then,
I treated it only as an order.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.780
I doubted it

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.220
but didn't know how to resist.

00:08:19.179 --> 00:08:20.780
You think of everyone else,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.020
except yourself.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.900
Heaven showed me mercy

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:28.419
by letting me meet you
when my life hung by a thread.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.140
Zhilou,

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.340
I am fond of you.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.660
You're the only one I wish

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.340
to spend my life with.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.300
There's no affection
between me and Liluo.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.420
If we marry blindly,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.820
it wouldn't

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:43.979
be fair

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:45.458
to you, me,

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:46.578
or even her.

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:46.899
But...

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.139
I will complete the task
my father assigned.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.779
I will attend the Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.220
But after the ritual ends,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.779
I will report to my father

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.940
to dissolve the betrothal with Liluo.

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:02.259
I know what you're worried about.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:03.619
But don't you think...

00:09:04.579 --> 00:09:06.658
entrusting the safety of the world

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:08.259
to a political marriage

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.259
is absurd?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.899
Even without this marriage,

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:13.578
I am still a Dragon.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:15.779
Ever since I took up the Icebound Sword,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.259
guarding the sanctuary

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:19.300
has been my purpose in this life.

00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:23.300
But if you do that,

00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:26.220
your path will only become harder.

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:29.420
People only care about the outcome.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.139
They never see the struggles

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.779
you faced along the way.

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:34.979
They will only scold you

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:37.580
for forsaking your duty

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.340
for a human girl.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:41.940
You'll be insulted as well,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.580
possibly even more than me.

00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:50.259
I, Feng Zhilou,

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:53.139
grew up under people's contempt.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.379
I'm not afraid.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:56.859
Then if one day,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.060
the Demons invade,

00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:00.979
will you stand with me against them?

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.779
That was already my dream

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.460
before I met you.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.460
If I cannot even protect the one I love,

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:14.540
how could I
protect all life in the world?

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:36.899
Li Yue

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.099
has a face far older than her years

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.578
and is riddled with sickness.

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:41.418
Her voice

00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:43.300
sounds like that
of a 100-year-old woman.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:44.818
Not only that,

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:46.660
her skin and body

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.058
are like withered wood,

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:49.340
far too aged.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.458
I noticed this condition

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:52.259
in the Demons during my recent

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.899
demon hunt as well.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.658
When demonic energy invades humans,

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:57.259
it causes rapid demonization.

00:10:57.299 --> 00:10:58.899
If they don't drink human blood in time,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.259
they wither like dead branches

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.619
and suffer excruciating pain.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:04.739
This is why the Demons

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.499
could wipe out human villages.

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:08.700
So you're saying

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.139
she was never taking

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.940
any life-prolonging tonic,

00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:14.859
but human blood?

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:18.178
The blood she drank

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:20.259
couldn't fuse with her own,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.779
so it poisoned her from within.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:24.339
Did Li Yue

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.619
keep a human blood vessel

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.060
just to feed her blood needs

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:28.259
and keep herself young?

00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:30.739
That is horrifying.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.660
(I remember something. Come with me.)

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.479
(Li Yue isn't
of the Saintess bloodline.)

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.160
(She must drink
the Saintess' blood to stay young.)

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.499
Those who drink blood
inherit its powers,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.938
but long-term use

00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:15.538
causes backlash,

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:17.899
leading to blood poisoning.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.099
In the end,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.460
they die violently.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.538
That old fiend is close by.

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:23.739
Search every corner!

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:25.379
Xiaoyu,

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:26.899
I can't escape this time.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.298
No.

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:29.019
- Stay hidden here.
- No, Grandpa.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.099
Come out when it's quiet outside.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.219
Remember the medical texts

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.099
and prescriptions I left you.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.859
Remember every single word.

00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:39.180
This is the final hope

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.818
I passed down to you.

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:41.499
Grandpa!

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.259
Don't go.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.538
Let's go together.

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:44.540
Xiaoyu,

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.339
life will be very hard

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.619
in the days to come.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.460
But

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:49.698
you must also remember.

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:50.739
You are a physician.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.660
You can cure others,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.259
and you can cure yourself too.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.178
Keep searching!

00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:55.778
Yes.

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:56.219
No.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.818
Hurry!

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:57.859
Grandpa!

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.739
Go in.

00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:00.820
Grandpa.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:23.499
Can a green hand

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.540
really treat my headache?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.019
Mother,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.938
she's the apprentice

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:30.379
that old quack left behind.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.298
We were going to kill her with him.

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:34.578
But she turned out to be an orphan,

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:36.180
and she knows medicine well.

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:37.859
I figured

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.220
she might be more useful
than that old man.

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:45.379
Can you read and write?

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.739
I can only read

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:48.739
the labels in the apothecary,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.099
but I can't write.

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:51.379
Because...

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:54.580
they won't let me write prescriptions.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.259
Without a voice,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.300
she can't speak out.

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:17.499
Xiaoyu,

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:19.859
don't be afraid.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.899
With me here,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.259
no one will ever bully you again.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.460
Good thing you secretly learned to write

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.979
and recorded everything.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.340
Otherwise,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.220
what they did to you

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.220
would never be known.

00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:37.178
The Wujing City Lord

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:38.578
and that Dark Dhuta beside her

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:40.019
are truly vicious.

00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:42.658
I must report this to my father.

00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:44.220
Don't act rashly yet.

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:45.739
Find evidence first.

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:48.859
No.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.339
I'm not worried about the ritual

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.619
or the engagement.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.619
I just don't want to spook them.

00:14:54.699 --> 00:14:55.979
I don't want to endanger

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.820
the poor soul giving Li Yue her blood.

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:02.739
Zhilou,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.139
welcome back.

00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:05.779
Hunbao?

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.899
Zhilou,

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.298
why didn't you have Young Master

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:09.899
wipe out those villains
in Longevity Hall

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.180
all in one go?

00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:13.379
Are you still mad at him?

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.779
Of course not.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.339
The inspection ritual

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.259
for the Wujing Saintess
is about to begin.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.418
No matter how many

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.139
cruel things Li Yue has done,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.219
the Saintess exists

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.458
to protect the sanctuary

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:25.340
and the mortal realm.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.139
I don't want to trouble Chu Moshang.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.499
In the end,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.300
you're still thinking for Young Master.

00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:33.499
Those villains

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.340
should just be
bitten to death by vipers.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.859
No, wait.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.460
We snakes wouldn't want to bite her.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.658
One day, I'll reveal the truth

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:44.779
about the blood poisoning

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.340
and give justice

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:47.660
to the victims.

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:48.979
Zhilou,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.778
to support you,

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:50.859
I'll give you a treasure.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.820
What treasure?

00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:57.058
This was formed from the century-old

00:15:57.059 --> 00:15:59.619
snake skin I shed.

00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:01.899
Why are you disgusted?

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.660
It'll help you big time.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.580
Zhilou, my cloak is magical, right?

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:10.379
With this on,

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.979
we can slip right in.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.859
Hunbao,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.818
you're unbelievable.

00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:16.339
Zhilou,

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.458
how do we find the person

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:19.220
who provides blood for Wujing City Lord?

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:24.940
The inspection ritual is about to begin.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.219
Li Yue may feel better after taking

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.658
the new tonic I made.

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:31.420
But if she wants her youth back,
she'll have to drink blood again.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.139
She'll definitely

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.938
entrust such secret matters

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:36.619
to her most trusted daughter, Liluo.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.460
We'll just

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.099
wait for them to act.

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:02.300
Wait here.

00:18:07.699 --> 00:18:08.819
Liluo.

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:10.498
Is that you?

00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:11.379
Mother, it's me.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.379
Zhilou,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.579
it's your mother.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.259
It's been days.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.660
Did they do anything to you?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.100
No.

00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:22.100
It's almost the Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual.

00:18:22.459 --> 00:18:24.299
Her Lordship wouldn't dare harm me.

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:25.938
Once my identity is confirmed,

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.498
I can get you out of here.

00:18:27.499 --> 00:18:29.019
That's wonderful.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.259
Liluo,

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.259
it's all my fault.

00:18:34.939 --> 00:18:36.018
I made you

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:38.900
suffer with me
in Wujing all these years.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.660
Soon it will all be over.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.979
Mother,

00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:48.940
you've suffered worse.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.979
Liluo.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.380
Mother,

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:25.180
I'll take my leave now.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.874
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:58.870

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:34.624
♪Chance meetings fade,
just empty rooms left behind♪

00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:40.257
♪You brought a wave
that stirred a wild, restless sea♪

00:20:40.537 --> 00:20:46.432
♪Light as a feather,
yet it sank an island deep in me♪

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:53.170
♪In that one moment,
life's grip I couldn't break or sway♪

00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:58.932
♪Leaving me lost in memories,
small and fading away♪
