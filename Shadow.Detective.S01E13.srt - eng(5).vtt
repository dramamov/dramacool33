Huang Kaiyuan must've learned about

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.830
what happened in the prison.

You said you had heard from Dr. Ding.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.170
What did she find?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520
We'll know when we get to her office.

Why are you here?

What do you mean by that?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.250
Isn't here exactly where I should be?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.890
He was around when Dr. Ding contacted me.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.870
According to protocol,

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:48.960
you should both

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.230
stay clear of this old case

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.500
and distant yourselves
from the investigation.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.000
As police officers,

Anything wrong, Dr. Ding?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.950
Lu, take a look at this report.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.270
These clothes are from too long ago,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.040
so there aren't many useful clues on them.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.840
Nonetheless,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.190
I found this.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.140
At first,
I thought it was just a piece of insole.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.960
But as I observed closely later,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.120
I found some writing on it.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.920
What does it say?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.720
It's illegible.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.320
The characters are blurred.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.130
Don't touch it.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.750
Though I've removed the stains
on the surface,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.150
there's still mold on it.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.510
In addition,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.510
I think

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.720
these paper fragments

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.920
were probably glued together on purpose.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.560
When I attempted to separate them,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.680
I almost ruined this piece of evidence.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.409
Are there any other solutions?

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.800
Not that I can think of.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.680
But there may be hope if you know someone

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.940

some old documents in the past,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.909
but most of the work was easy,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.390
like removing stains

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.720
and consolidating the writing.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.159
But this...

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.200
can hardly be called as paper.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.890
Don't worry.

she may overthink everything

if she's left alone.

to move in with me for a while.

Here's another thing.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.270
I compared your blood with the bloodstains

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.270
on those clothes.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.340
It turns out they don't match.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.920
Perhaps that's Jingning's blood
on my clothes.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.870
I haven't told Guan Cen about it yet,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.040
because those clothes are yours,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.500
and you have the final say.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.000
Before the truth is figured out,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.300
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.800
You've been taking care of me

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
this entire time.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.480
Previously,
you even cleared me of suspicion.

I'm very grateful to you.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:35.669

Let me pour the tea.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.220
You know about

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.000
the prison riot, right?

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.730
I've heard a bit about it.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.320
Wasn't it quickly contained

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.960
and didn't cause massive casualties?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.760
That's right.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.880
Is there more to it?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.270
We found four bodies in the prison.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.440
Three of them belong to

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.480
three inmates
who had died before the riot.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.110
The warden and I
have been friends for years.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.690
He's under a lot of pressure
from the brass.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.750
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.390
So, I'd like to ask you to look into

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.240
this matter.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.670
Now that you've said so,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.600
I'll definitely do my best to help.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.630
But isn't Guan Cen more suited

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.920
to investigate cases of this kind?

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.930
One of the bodies

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.550
belongs to an inmate named Bao Yiming.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.960
I bet you're rather familiar

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.480
with his alias—

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.980
the Ghost.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.390
The Ghost?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.900
You mean...

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.120
the missing suspect of that old case
concerning Lu Yizhen?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.750
Yes.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.410
As you know,
Guan Cen is fixated on this old case.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.930
So, after much consideration,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.670
I decided not to tell him.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.170
Every strike was meant to kill.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.930
The killer had quite a clear purpose.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.050
Director Du,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.810
something seems off.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.500
Take a look

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.660
at their ages.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.440
The three of them

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.570
were sent to prison for the same theft?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.670
It's written here
that they were 45, 48 and 42 years old,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.670
respectively.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.360
But they seemed to be
in their 30s when they died.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.310
I think they deliberately went to prison
under fake identities.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.670
If that's true,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.660
the situation has become tricky.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.000
What about the doctor hired by the prison?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.840
Wasn't he supposed to give

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.910
basic checkups to all the inmates?

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.510
How did he miss on
something so obvious and fishy?

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.040
Who's the doctor
working with the prison now?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.240
Currently, it's a doctor

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.440
named Huang Kaiyuan.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.670
He used to work at Jinghu Hospital.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.940
Later on, he opened his own clinic.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.270
I'm not sure what strings he pulled

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.330
to solicit business from the prison.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.390
Look into him.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.130
Okay.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.720
Dr. Ding.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.390
Dr. Ding.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.240
Are you investigating a case here,
Director Du?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.360
Yes, an old one.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.940
An old case?

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.280
Didn't these four bodies
arrive not long ago?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.290
They died of unusual causes,
so I came for a look.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.070
Anything I can help with?

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:18.840
Nothing.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.290
Our work's almost done.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.130
Alright.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.240
Don't bother. Leave it to my colleagues.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:26.870
Thank you.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.630
I appreciate your help, Dr. Ding.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.290
No problem.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.330
I'm honored to be of assistance to you,
Director Du.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.550
I see.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.120
We'll take our leave now.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.600
Goodbye.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.910
Are you here to see the doctor?

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.170
Did you make an appointment?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.630
We're here
to ask Huang Kaiyuan some questions.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.490
Who are you? How dare you barge in?

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.750
Stop, or I'll report you to the police.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:59.430
No need.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.130
I'm an officer myself.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.570
The Intelligence Department?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.860
Director Du, please.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.840
Come on in.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.030
Director Du,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.160
have some tea.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.920
Take a seat.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.510
Dr. Huang,
besides running a private clinic,

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.870
you also go to the prison
to treat inmates.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.000
How very busy of you.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.420
Director Du...

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.870
You flatter me.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.620
I'm just making a living.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.100
Nothing more than that.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.670
Dr. Huang, what exactly

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.000
do you do in the prison?

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.320
Oh, this question...

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.320
Well, you see,

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.440
I'm a doctor.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.290
My job in the prison

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.550
is mainly about

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.200
giving regular checkups

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.120
to inmates.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.320
If any of them are found sick,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.670
I'll prescribe medicine for them.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.790
That's all.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.150
You know about the recent

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.280
prison riot, right?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.850
I've heard about it.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600
Not a lot, though.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.780
During the riot...

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.600
To be exact, before and after the riot,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.060
altogether four prisoners were found dead.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.790
Are you aware of it, Dr. Huang?

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.440
Director Du, about that...

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.600
As you know,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.000
the conditions in the prison are rough.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.480
Isn't it...

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.230
normal that a few inmates die
every now and then?

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.860
The state that three bodies are in

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.080
contradicts the registration details

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.540
from when they entered the prison.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.670
I suspect they used false identities.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.360
All of their profiles

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.220
were processed by you, Dr. Huang.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.170
Didn't you notice anything wrong?

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.440
Look,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.980
Director Du, you hold high office,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.390
so you may not be well informed of...

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.440
how certain things work

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.000
at lower levels.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.860
What do you mean?

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.440
Let me put it this way.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.100
Those who have been put in jail

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.120
used to be thugs

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.040
that did all kinds of evil.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.540
From a social perspective,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.980
putting them in prison

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.040
is actually

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.050
eliminating public menaces.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.630
Therefore,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.080
after they were put behind bars,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.030
their specific personal details

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.210
and their life status

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.060
would no longer matter.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.720
Director Du, come on.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.260
Have some tea.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:56.790
Come on.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.800
Have some tea.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.840
Guan Cen, wash them carefully.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.170
There's still mud here.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.910
Si Min, easy on the salt.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.620
Yizhen hates salty food.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.360
Easy on the salt?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.090
The salt has been used up by you.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.600
Alright. Stop bickering.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.530
I'll go buy some.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.560
It's not safe to go out alone this late.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.760
You go with me then.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.660
Better let me do it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.400
You wash the vegetables.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.680
I'll go with you.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.920
You wash the vegetables.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
They'll be safe going out as a group.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.390
Linfeng is hopeless.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.630
What? Didn't you let him go buy salt?

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.890
I presented an opportunity to him,
yet he didn't seize it.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.220
How can I not be worried?

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.700
Si Min.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.990
I'm being serious when I tell you this:

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.270
I'm not interested in your cousin.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.069
Stop trying to fix me up with him.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.440
Do you want to repeat your mistake

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.099
by getting back with Guan Cen?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.240
You want to tell me something?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.640
How did you figure it out?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.920
It's nothing.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.980
Don't say it if you don't feel like it.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.890
You don't want to hear it at all?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.280
What if it's about the Ghost?

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.070
Did you find him?

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.310
Yes,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.320
but not when he was alive.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.630
He's dead now?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.550
You heard about the recent prison riot,

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.400
right?

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.530
The prison claimed
there were no casualties.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.530
But in fact,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.000
four inmates died,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.110
one of which was the Ghost.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.990
His name in the prison

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.540
was Bao Yiming.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.080
How did you find out about it?

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.710
I got it from Director Huo.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.600
He asked me in secret
to investigate this case.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.310
By withholding such information from me,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.570
Director Huo must be
trying to keep me out of this matter.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.030
Why are you telling me now?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.320
I conducted an investigation

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.920
and found this case complex.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.510
It might be related to that old case.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.620
I'd like to help Lu Yizhen
uncover the truth.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.310
If you want to act the hero
in front of Lu Yizhen,

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.110
you don't need to be telling me all this.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.400
I know
you're also investigating that old case.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.330
You must've found have many leads.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.270
Why don't we join forces

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.670
to solve the case sooner?

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.720
I'll think about it.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.020
Think about it?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.680
What's there to think about?

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.070
Without me telling you about the Ghost,

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.340
you will waste a lot of time

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.550
on a dead man!

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.010
I didn't force you to tell me anything.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.080
Guan Cen...

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.550
This is really not cool.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.830
Guan Cen,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.940
I won't share my findings
with you anymore.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.600
You just won't appreciate it.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.700
Wait for me!

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.030
Soon, there will be a gathering

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.590
for Chongde University alumni.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.750
Zhuo Chaoxiong
has cordially invited alumni

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.440
from all walks of life to his mansion.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.840
All the prominent alumni

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.240
will attend the gathering.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.680
Maybe many young elites will be there.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.440
I'm talking to you.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.310
How resilient of you, Dr. Si,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.400
for getting over

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.660
your true love so soon.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.530
You think I want to go out?

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.640
I'm doing all this for you, okay?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.290
Right now, you can choose from two men.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.790
Du Linfeng—you don't like him.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.480
Guan Cen—

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.540
You don't like him.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.900
He's bound to break your heart.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.350
To turn the situation around,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.810
you must meet someone new.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.600
I refuse to meet anyone new.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.070
How are you supposed to break out

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.480
of the current dangerous situation
if you don't meet someone new?

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.750
How am I in a dangerous situation now?

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.980
I'm doing perfectly fine.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.550
It was you who met your true love

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.950
and got yourself in a dangerous situation.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.930
What if you meet

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.920
a handsome and elegant gentleman

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.250
at the alumni gathering,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.300
click with him right away,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.880
and instantly fall in love
with each other?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.750
You can't miss out

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.920
on any opportunity to find true love.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.390
Anyway, I've already got

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.970
an admission ticket for you.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.270
On the evening two days from now,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.800
I look forward to seeing you
turn on the charm.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.990
That was rude.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.350
Whoever killed them must be brutal.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.260
Yes.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.120
They were all killed with sharp weapons

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.560
in a similar way,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.590
indicating there was only one killer.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.790
Have their identities been confirmed?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.000
They went to prison under fake identities.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.130
I haven't got any clues
about their real identities yet.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.760
How about

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.150
I offer you a fresh take?

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.260
Dr. Ding.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.440
Look,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.830
there are thick calluses

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.590
on the fingers of all the three bodies.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.030
There are strap marks on their shoulders,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.920
and if you look carefully,
you'll find their shoulders uneven.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.120
I think they used to do heavy labor work.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.920
Besides, the skin on their feet is chapped
with rashes

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.850
and signs of repeated scratching,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.270
all of which suggests

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.080
long-term exposure to seawater.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.680
They probably had worked as loaders

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.510
at the docks.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.590
That's a possibility.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.510
Try pursuing that lead.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.440
Perhaps you'll have new findings.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.400
You're actually more perceptive
than I imagined, Dr. Ding,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.200
for noticing such tiny details.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.590
There's a lot you don't know.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.640
But you'll learn.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.050
You've arrived.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.920
Place the items here.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.160
Careful.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.440
Sir,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.960
who were those people passing by?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.350
Mr. Zhuo rules this dock.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.400
Don't you know that?

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.790
I...

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.020
Of course I know.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.950
You mean Mr. Zhuo, Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.790
We came here specifically for him.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.050
Then why couldn't you recognize his men?

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.000
Sir,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.590
the two of us are new here.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.400
You've been here longer.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.930
Please give us some advice.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.930
You're new here?

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.100
Just like you, a lot of people here

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.440
are hoping to be noticed by Mr. Zhuo.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.270
Yeah.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.240
Sir,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.060
this dork is packed with people.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.030
Any ideas on how long it will take

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.150
for me and my fellow to be picked?

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.310
Just be patient.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.600
Don't you see I'm still waiting?

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.070
Even you haven't been picked yet.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.350
Our wait will be endless then, won't it?

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.160
Yes.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480
Not necessarily.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.400
A few months ago, three young men

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.790
were selected and taken away.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.790
They've never come back.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.200
They must be living a comfortable life

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.680
of extravagance now.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.710
You're still young.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.430
You still stand a chance.
Keep up the good work!

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.660
Thank you, sir.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.520
Thank you, sir.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.310
I heard he was going off to a meeting.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.800
At Mr. Zhuo's, as I heard.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.400
Really?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.540
Du Linfeng.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.160
I envy him.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.400
Let's go.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.480
Won't it be nice if we are selected

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.750
one day just like he was?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.350
Liu, Li.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.030
I've noticed
that you often practice martial arts.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.460
You've got your chance today—

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.990
follow these gentlemen's lead
and work hard.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.750
Is there a way to sneak into that place?

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.510
I can have access to wherever I want
in Shanghai.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.920
[Huang Residence, general practitioner
trained in Western medicine]

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.160
You remember the dosage for the patient

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.290
in Room No. 3, right?

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.410
Mr. Zhuo is here.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.920
Greetings, Mr. Zhuo, Young Master Zhuo.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.050
Is Dr. Huang around?

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:40.830
Yes.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.060
I'll notify him of your arrival.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.940
No need.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.440
Father!

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.180
I'll wait for you here.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.110
Okay.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.970
Young Master Zhuo,

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.600
why not sit here for a while?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.080
Don't worry about me.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.360
Get back to your work.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.600
Okay.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.380
I'll go get my work done.
You take care of him.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.410
Do you have any other discomfort?

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.440
Besides the ailments you mentioned,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.900
I also have headaches
and ringing in my ears.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.200
Anyway,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.350
I just lose my temper easily.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.390
Don't worry.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.290
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.590
But remember,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.640
try not to get angry.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.800
Anger damages the liver.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.070
You must learn to manage your anger,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.270
or there will be serious consequences.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.710
So you do know the serious consequences
of getting me mad.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.360
What was that incident
in the prison about?

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.990
Well,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.200
it was indeed my fault.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.530
I didn't handle it well.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.310
Stop patronizing me.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.590
Don't you think I know

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.200
what the Ghost is capable of?

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.200
Many of my men died there.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.540
Could he have killed them alone?

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.960
By the time I got into the prison,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.310
those people had disappeared.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.350
This is still perplexing me now.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.720
I really don't know what happened.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.220
Since you can't give me an explanation,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.770
you'll take the heat on this one,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.140
when the higher-ups visit

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.200
tomorrow.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.910
Go and get the materials

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:40.390
we need.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.680
I'll pick you up later.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.030
Okay.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.000
Let's set out early to scout that place.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.200
That way, if anything goes wrong,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.480
we'll have an escape route.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.210
Don't worry.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.720
I've had the area
around the Zhuo Residence

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720
scouted, and a map drawn

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.440
about it.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.290
We can navigate with the map.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.860
The challenge is how to gain entry.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.480
The ball will be held
at the Zhuo Residence.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.010
There's no way we can get in.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.690
I'm going to walk right in, of course.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.170
You have an idea?

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.370
I am the distinguished Mr. Du,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.750
who's on the guest list.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.110
But you are not.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.160
So you'll have to stake out by the gate.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.290
Let's split up then.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.000
Okay.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.880
Nobody knows

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.510
what this matter will lead to.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.990
Don't tell Lu Yizhen about any of this.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.640
Just keep it between you and me.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.440
Sure thing.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.720
Dong.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.550
Have there been

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.480
new cases at our station recently?

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.290
No.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.970
Then where was he off to?

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.680
How am I supposed to know?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.550
Didn't he tell you?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.830
Don't be so nosy.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.960
He must have a reason

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.350
for keeping it secret.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.550
Besides,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.360
it's better that he's gone,
because we get to relax.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.880
Xu Ruidong.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.070
Do you really not know anything?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.880
I...

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.030
I really don't know anything.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.160
If I had got any information,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.760
I would've told you already.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.270
Right.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.440
Even if he had told you about a problem,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.040
you wouldn't be able to help.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.400
Some files about the case we worked on

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.960
last time are still in the archives.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.110
Could you go get them for me?

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.760
I can't carry

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.020
that many files alone.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680
I'm not going.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.000
I just sat down for a rest.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.480
Do it now,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.740
or I'll tell Guan Cen you've slacked off.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.760
I'll go with you.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.800
Lu Yizhen,

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.220
you...

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.270
Zhuo Chaoxiong?

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.570
How come this name sounds so familiar?

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.770
The alumni gathering... Isn't it today?

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.480
Si Min,
